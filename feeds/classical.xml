      <title>Alcina review – Opera North clear clutter but there’s minimal magic on this enchanted isle</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/07/handel-alcina-review-opera-north-tim-albery</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grand theatre, Leeds&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Handel’s opera is full of glorious music but its improbable plot makes it difficult to stage; Tim Albery’s intelligent production only fitfully succeeds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few will challenge &lt;a href="https://www.operanorth.co.uk/whats-on/alcina-2022/"&gt;Alcina&lt;/a&gt;’s claims to contain some of the finest vocal writing that even Handel ever penned. The problem is with staging it. Under the skin, Alcina engages with serious stuff – desire, betrayal, rejection and trust. But the plot – an island enchantress battles to retain power over her lovers – is wrapped in artifice and improbability. Many productions fall short. Tim Albery’s intelligent staging for Opera North – the first of &lt;a href="https://www.glyndebourne.com/events/alcina/"&gt;several Alcinas in the UK&lt;/a&gt; over the coming months – is, ultimately, another of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Albery’s achievement is to have cleared enough of Alcina’s clutter to ensure focus on the work’s emotional core. The score is heavily cut, reshaped into two acts, not three. &lt;a href="https://www.hannahclark.co.uk/"&gt;Hannah Clark&lt;/a&gt;’s perky designs, stripped back and sustainable, consist of 1960s upholstered chairs and a bearskin rug. Costumes are contemporary, save the occasional sword and breastplate. &lt;a href="https://mesmer.co.uk/people/ian-william-galloway"&gt;Ian Galloway&lt;/a&gt;’s video backdrop initially suggests an island of dreams but morphs into an oppressive heart of darkness jungle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/07/handel-alcina-review-opera-north-tim-albery"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Bajazet review – Vivaldi finally gets his London premiere</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/06/bajazet-review-vivaldi-baroque-opera-linbury</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linbury theatre, London&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Vivaldi wrote 90 operas but this is the first of his works to be staged at the ROH; Adele Thomas’s engaging production makes a strong case for this to be first of many&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-odd years ago everyone was too busy listening to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/feb/15/classicalmusicandopera"&gt;Vivaldi&lt;/a&gt;’s concertos to bother about his 90 or so operas. Two decades ago the operas began to appear in earnest on disc; now, with audiences ready to look beyond Handel for a baroque opera fix, they are reaching the stage. Bajazet is the first Vivaldi opera to be staged under the Royal Opera House’s roof, and if anyone needs persuading that this is a good idea then Adele Thomas’s production, a collaboration with &lt;a href="https://www.irishnationalopera.ie/"&gt;Irish National Opera&lt;/a&gt; that has already toured Ireland for two weeks, should do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas adds a bit of helpful context with an opening monologue giving the story so far, introducing the title character as “the Thunderbolt of Allah” and his captor, Tamerlano, is a warlord descended from Genghis Khan. The ensuing story mainly milks the baroque opera tropes of love, betrayal and disguise, but it’s a credit to Thomas’s insightful direction and to the six-strong cast that we remain invested in it, rooting for Gianluca Margheri’s noble-sounding Bajazet and wondering what James Laing’s thuggish, volatile Tamerlano will do next.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/06/bajazet-review-vivaldi-baroque-opera-linbury"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>John Williams at 90: ‘He is so much smarter than his critics’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/03/john-williams-at-90-he-is-so-much-smarter-than-his-critics</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;He has created some of the most memorable film scores of all time, including Jaws, Star Wars and ET. Is it time he was regarded as a great composer? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a story that John Williams was working on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/schindler-s-list"&gt;Schindler’s List&lt;/a&gt; when he suggested to Steven Spielberg that he needed a better composer for his overwhelming Holocaust drama. “I know, but they’re all dead,” replied the director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anecdote is redolent not only of Williams’s humble view of his handiwork but also speaks to the traditional gulf in perception between the populist Williams – he has the most entries of any living composer in Classic FM’s hall of fame – and the vaunted masters of classical music. Celebrating his 90th birthday on 8 February, Williams has a body of film work that encompasses blockbusters (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D0ZQPqeJkk"&gt;nine Star Wars&lt;/a&gt; movies, four &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgncJgSbbck"&gt;Indiana Joneses&lt;/a&gt;, three &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB-c85V8Zsg"&gt;Harry Potters&lt;/a&gt;, two &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHalXjs0cDA"&gt;Jurassic Parks&lt;/a&gt; and the first &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78N2SP6JFaI"&gt;Superman film&lt;/a&gt;) and serious historical fare (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaHdQXcEqoY"&gt;JFK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=057A1RdssoU"&gt;Schindler’s List&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQzGNGgHLqo"&gt;Saving Private Ryan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJVuqYkI2jQ"&gt;Lincoln&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/03/john-williams-at-90-he-is-so-much-smarter-than-his-critics"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Beethoven: Piano Concertos and Choral Fantasy review – reissued reminder of a peerless pianist</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/03/beethoven-the-five-piano-concertos-etc-review-rudolf-serkin</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rudolf Serkin/Bavarian RSO/Rafael Kubelík&lt;br&gt;(Orfeo, three CDs)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This recording of Serkin from 1977 highlights a 20th-century great who brought musical purpose and intellectual rigour to every detail &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rudolf Serkin ranks among the greatest of 20th-century pianists; his repertoire ranged from Bach to Reger, but Beethoven was always at its very heart. In a career of well over half a century, he made numerous recordings of the piano concertos, but only two studio sets of all five – with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/dec/06/beethoven-piano-concertos-sonatas-review"&gt;Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra in the early 1950s&lt;/a&gt;, and another in Boston 30 years later, with Seiji Ozawa conducting the Boston Symphony. I heard Serkin live only a handful of times, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/apr/07/classicalmusicandopera.shopping"&gt;all of them remarkable occasions&lt;/a&gt;, but those who were able to follow him more regularly always maintained that in the recording studio his playing seemed to lose some of the intensity that it conveyed so powerfully in concert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the autumn of 1977, in the Herkulessaal in Munich, he played all five Beethoven concertos as well as the Choral Fantasy in a series of concerts with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra under Rafael Kubelík, another musician who, like Serkin, always put himself at the service of the music. Recordings of those performances were first released on disc in 2005, but in Britain at least they seem to have disappeared quickly from the catalogue; their reissue now makes available again what is in every respect a historic musical document.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/03/beethoven-the-five-piano-concertos-etc-review-rudolf-serkin"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Theodora review – bombs, a brothel and a brilliant cast</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/01/theodora-review-katie-mitchell-handel-royal-opera-house-london</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Royal Opera House, London&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Katie Mitchell’s modern-day staging of Handel’s oratorio is probing but problematic. The cast, however, is one of the finest ever assembled for the work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/04/handel-where-to-start-with-his-music"&gt;Handel&lt;/a&gt; considered Theodora the greatest of his oratorios. Few today would disagree with him, though it was surprisingly unsuccessful at its Covent Garden premiere in 1750, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/royal-opera-house"&gt;Royal Opera&lt;/a&gt;’s new production effectively marks its overdue homecoming. Notoriety, however, began to cling to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/katie-mitchell"&gt;Katie Mitchell’&lt;/a&gt;s staging well before opening night, thanks to trigger warnings about “explicit violence” on the Royal Opera website, and the much reported employment of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/29/royal-opera-house-hires-intimacy-coordinator-ita-obrien-handel-theodora-sex-scenes"&gt;intimacy coordinator Ita O’Brien&lt;/a&gt; to ensure the performers felt comfortable with the sex scenes. All this has to some extent been a bit of a distraction, as the production is for the most part a reined-in affair, and neither particularly explicit (either sexually or in its depiction of violence) nor quite as inflammatory as anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitchell’s stance is typically probing and interrogative. Distrusting Handel’s supposed depiction of his heroine as stoic or passive (with which not everyone would agree) Mitchell makes her a fundamentalist revolutionary rather than a martyr and relocates the oratorio to a modern-day alternative reality, setting it in an embassy that has been infiltrated by Christian resistance members bent on destroying the male-dominated pagan Roman system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/01/theodora-review-katie-mitchell-handel-royal-opera-house-london"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Ruth Slenczynska: the pupil of Rachmaninov still releasing music at 97</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/30/ruth-slenczynska-pupil-rachmanivov-still-releasing-music-age-97</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pianist who has played for five US presidents says great composer taught her to incorporate colour in music&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greatest lesson Ruth Slenczynska learned from the Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninov was that sounds have colour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 90 years ago, the nine year-old Slenczynska was practising one of Rachmaninov’s preludes when he asked her to join him at the window. It was springtime in Paris, and the avenues were lined with mimosa trees laden with fluffy, golden blossoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/30/ruth-slenczynska-pupil-rachmanivov-still-releasing-music-age-97"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ita O’Brien working on production of Handel’s Theodora to ensure actors feel comfortable during passionate scenes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love, power, agony and death – throughout its history opera has been cherished for its displays of unbridled passion. But for those enacting scenes of murder, sex and sometimes even rape, words like consent and agency have rarely come up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, in what’s thought to be a British first, the Royal Opera House (ROH) is consulting with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/25/normal-people-intimacy-coordinator-works-sally-rooney-sex-scenes"&gt;Ita O’Brien&lt;/a&gt; – an intimacy coordinator who ensures actors feel comfortable during such scenes – for Katie Mitchell’s new production of Theodora, opening on Monday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/29/royal-opera-house-hires-intimacy-coordinator-ita-obrien-handel-theodora-sex-scenes"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Julia Fischer/LPO/Thomas Søndergård review – authoritative but short on charm</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/06/julia-fischer-lpo-thomas-sondergard-review-mozart</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Royal Festival Hall, London&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Technically brilliant violinist Julia Fischer rendered Mozart oddly joyless, but Thomas Søndergård’s vivid conducting injected some life into the evening&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The violinist &lt;a href="https://www.juliafischer.com/"&gt;Julia Fischer&lt;/a&gt; is artist-in-residence with the London Philharmonic this spring. Her first group of concerts with the orchestra focusses on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/05/mozart-where-to-start-with-his-music"&gt;Mozart&lt;/a&gt;, with all five of his solo-violin concertos spread across three programmes. In the second of them, with &lt;a href="https://www.askonasholt.com/artists/thomas-sondergard/"&gt;Thomas Søndergård&lt;/a&gt; conducting, she played the fifth concerto, in A major, K219, as well as the Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola, K364.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no doubting the technical security of Fischer’s playing, nor the understated authority of her musicianship. But her account of the concerto was unsmiling and short on charm. With rather curt, peremptory phrasing, emotions kept on the shortest rein and little inclination to relish moments of lyricism even in the central Adagio, it was all oddly joyless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/classical-music/julia-fischer-plays-mozart-adventures-and-homages"&gt;A further concert in the series&lt;/a&gt; will be held on 12 February.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/06/julia-fischer-lpo-thomas-sondergard-review-mozart"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>LSO/Noseda review – uncompromising Shostakovich and exhilarating Beethoven</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/04/lso-gianandrea-noseda-review-shostakovich-beethoven-barbican</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barbican, London&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The bleak beauty of Shostakovich’s 14th symphony was explored to unsettling effect in a superb performance; the Beethoven that followed was focused and  full of energy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An impassioned protest against death,” is how &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/23/shostakovich-where-to-start-with-his-music"&gt;Shostakovich&lt;/a&gt; described his Fourteenth Symphony. Written at speed in 1969 when the composer was in hospital in Moscow after his second heart attack, you could argue that it represents music’s most disquieting confrontation with mortality. Part symphony, part song cycle for soprano and bass soloists, strings and percussion, it’s an unremittingly bleak piece that sets 11 poems about untimely death by poets who themselves died young. There’s little attempt to console, no suggestion of transcendence, only a numbing and pervasive sense of finality. For some, it is Shostakovich’s greatest score, though the emotional demands it makes on audiences and performers alike can make it uncomfortable listening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/sep/21/classicalmusicandopera1"&gt;Gianandrea Noseda&lt;/a&gt;’s performance with the London Symphony Orchestra, part of a current Shostakovich cycle, was typically uncompromising: a deeply unsettling exploration of a desiccated sound-world that eerily hovers at the limits of existence. Restraint and violence were garishly juxtaposed. String phrases seemed to echo across distances and abysses, and skeletal xylophone taps ushered death into taverns and on to battlefields.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/04/lso-gianandrea-noseda-review-shostakovich-beethoven-barbican"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Armonico Consort review – Scarlatti sparkles in anniversary concert</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/31/armonico-consort-review-scarlatti-sparkles-in-anniversary-concert</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The period instrument group joined with violinist Rachel Podger to perform music by a lesser-known Scarlatti – Francesco&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brother to the more famous &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/24/alessandro-scarlatti-opera-classical-music-soprano-elizabeth-watts"&gt;Alessandro&lt;/a&gt;, who composed more than 60 operas, and uncle to Domenico, whose 555 sonatas are one of the mainstays of the baroque keyboard repertoire, &lt;a href="http://www.hoasm.org/VIIIB/ScarlattiF.html"&gt;Francesco Scarlatti&lt;/a&gt; spent his life as a choir master, first in his native Sicily, and later in the British Isles, where his music was performed in London and at the &lt;a href="https://3choirs.org/about-the-festival/"&gt;Three Choirs festival&lt;/a&gt;; he apparently died in poverty in Dublin in 1741. Francesco’s own music is hardly known today, but one of the &lt;a href="https://www.armonico.org.uk/"&gt;Armonico Consort’s&lt;/a&gt; earliest concerts, 20 years ago, included both of his surviving large-scale choral works, a Dixit Dominus and a Mass. As part of the group’s 20th anniversary season they have programmed the two again, before recording them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pieces both date from the early 1700s, when Scarlatti was &lt;em&gt;maestro di cappella&lt;/em&gt; in Palermo; they are written for a 16-part choir, divided into four groups, with an orchestra of strings and trumpet. But as these performances under Armonico’s director &lt;a href="https://www.armonico.org.uk/about-us/christopher-monks/"&gt;Christopher Monks&lt;/a&gt; vividly demonstrated, those forces are often employed in a strikingly distinctive way. In the Dixit Dominus psalm setting verses for the full forces, sometimes fugal and occasionally densely chromatic, are interspersed not with the usual solo numbers but with sections highlighting each of the voice types in turn, while the mass draws very selectively on the full Latin mass – there’s no Credo or Agnus Dei – though the use of antiphonal effects and the deployment of solo voices is just as striking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/31/armonico-consort-review-scarlatti-sparkles-in-anniversary-concert"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The African Concert Series review – wild and shimmering piano gems</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October Gallery, London&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Rebeca Omordia launches this year’s series with a fascinating recital of music from Nigeria, Ghana, Morocco and South Africa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;African art music – a bridge between western classical forms and traditional melody and rhythm – has a determined champion in the Romanian-Nigerian pianist &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/mar/31/finding-africa-classical-music-rebeca-omordia-african-concert-series"&gt;Rebeca Omordia&lt;/a&gt;. She has made her life’s work a quest to discover and perform the output of composers – often unpublished – from right across that great continent. Judging by her inaugural recital in this year’s &lt;a href="https://theafricanconcertseries.co.uk/"&gt;African Concert Series&lt;/a&gt;, her determination is yielding fascinating results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine, if you can, a sensuous, serpentine Arabic melody in the left hand winding its way up towards a delicate filigree of sparkling stars in the right hand and you have something of the impression that Moroccan composer Nabil Benabdeljalil (b.1972) creates in his beautiful Nocturne No 4 from 2015. His romantic Nocturne No 6 from 2020, which expresses his intense joy at roaming the Middle Atlas mountains after lockdown, feels as though John Field himself might have been a ghostly presence at his side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theafricanconcertseries.co.uk/whats-on/"&gt;The African Concert Series runs until 5 December&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/29/african-concert-series-2022-rebeca-omordia-african-pianism-october-gallery-abdelkader-saadoun-review"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Classical home listening: young composers and Handel’s power women</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The National Youth Choir of Great Britain have been busy commissioning, while Sandrine Piau soars on Enchantresses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Despite the no-choral-singing strictures of lockdown, the&lt;a href="https://www.nycgb.org.uk/?gclid=CjwKCAiAxJSPBhAoEiwAeO_fP5xeR9iQcAlpecouhMiWUJFv0GZQSA9X2rIky1flr10yereKnlhPuhoCUKoQAvD_BwE"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nycgb.org.uk/?gclid=CjwKCAiAxJSPBhAoEiwAeO_fP5xeR9iQcAlpecouhMiWUJFv0GZQSA9X2rIky1flr10yereKnlhPuhoCUKoQAvD_BwE"&gt;National Youth Choir of Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has inspired nine striking new pieces by their four rising-star composers, featured onthe NYCGB’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://nmc-recordings.myshopify.com/products/nycgb-young-composers-scheme-3"&gt;Young Composers 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (NMC), director Ben Parry. In the sensuous, whispering Softly, the Welsh composer &lt;a href="https://derrijosephlewis.com/"&gt;Derri Joseph Lewis&lt;/a&gt; explores the uneasy experience of coming out as LGBTQ+. &lt;a href="https://www.kristinaarakelyan.com/"&gt;Kristina Arakelyan&lt;/a&gt; has set Wordsworth’s I Wandered Lonely As a Cloud, the choral textures rich and glowing. &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/annadisleysimpson"&gt;Anna Disley-Simpson&lt;/a&gt; has made atmospheric settings of Sara Teasdale’s &lt;a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?contentId=16347"&gt;February Twilight&lt;/a&gt; and a poem by Rudyard Kipling. For &lt;a href="https://www.alexhocomposer.com/"&gt;Alex Ho&lt;/a&gt;, British Chinese and based in London, the racial harassment faced by the UK’s south-east and east Asian communities has prompted Hush, spiky, menacing and poetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• “My ghost will haunt the tyrant”, blasts the mighty Cleopatra, exploding with anger and grief in Piangerò la sorte mia, one of her spectacular arias in &lt;em&gt;Giulio Cesare in Egitto.&lt;/em&gt; It’s one of the many highlights in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://lnk.to/Handel_Enchantresses"&gt;Handel: Enchantresses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Alpha Classics), the fourth joint venture between the crystalline-voiced French soprano &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sandrinepiau.com/"&gt;Sandrine Piau&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and Jérôme Correas, director and harpsichordist, and his baroque group &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lespaladins.com/"&gt;Les Paladins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Handel’s “enchantresses” include queens as well as sirens and sorceresses: Melissa (&lt;em&gt;Amadigi&lt;/em&gt;), Almirena (&lt;em&gt;Rinaldo&lt;/em&gt;), Alcina and Morgana (&lt;em&gt;Alcina&lt;/em&gt;) are all here, their vocal fireworks and heartfelt outpourings interspersed with movements from Handel’s Concerto Grosso in G minor, Op 6 No 6, and the A minor, Op 6 No 4.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/22/nycgb-young-composers-scheme-vol-3-review-national-youth-choir-great-britain-handel-enchantresses-sandrine-piau-les-paladins-correas"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Debussy: Pelléas et Mélisande review | Andrew Clements's classical album of the week</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/20/debussy-pelleas-et-melisande-review</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julien Behr/Vannina Santoni/Alexandre Duhamel/Les Siècles/François-Xavier Roth&lt;br&gt;(Harmonia Mundi)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Period instruments and French voices add an extra dimension to François-Xavier Roth’s recording&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.metopera.org/user-information/synopses-archive/pelleas-et-melisande"&gt;Pelléas&lt;/a&gt; is a one-off”, says &lt;a href="https://fxroth.com/biography/"&gt;François-Xavier Roth&lt;/a&gt; in the sleeve notes to his new recording, “The first exemplar of what opera was to become in the 20th and 21st centuries and of what it can no longer be”. As one of the turning points in the evolution of opera, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/07/debussy-where-to-start-with-his-music"&gt;Debussy’s&lt;/a&gt; masterpiece is already very well represented on disc, but Roth’s performance, which stems from a production at Opéra de Lille last year, differs from all its predecessors by having the period instruments of &lt;a href="https://www.lessiecles.com/"&gt;Les Siècles&lt;/a&gt; in the pit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an opera whose drama depends so much on the minutest nuances of the word-setting and the web of orchestral motifs underpinning it, the use of gut strings and turn-of-the-20th-century woodwind and brass adds an extra dimension to the expressive palette. The gains are obvious right from the opening, where the dark, slowly churning strings, playing without vibrato, conjure up the atmosphere of ambiguity and veiled menace that pervades the whole work, right through to the trickle of woodwind tears with which it ends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/20/debussy-pelleas-et-melisande-review"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Classical home listening: French song with Roderick Williams; Ennio Morricone’s cinema suites</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/15/mirages-the-art-of-french-song-roderick-williams-roger-vignoles-review-ennio-morricone-cinema-suites-violin-orchestra</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Williams and Roger Vignoles are on exquisite form on Mirages. Plus a fitting testament to the late, great film composer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• The album &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prestomusic.com/classical/products/9267970--mirages-the-art-of-french-song"&gt;Mirages: The Art of French Song&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Champs Hill), with the baritone Roderick Williams and pianist Roger Vignoles, grew out of a Wigmore Hall recital, recreating the intimacy and shape of a concert programme to delicious effect. In no area of repertoire, it seems, is Williams not at ease as well as expert. Recent Schubert song cycles (with pianist Iain Burnside) and English repertoire stand out in his varied discography. Now, with Vignoles as an ever idiomatic and responsive partner, he has turned to French song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opening with the sensual mystery of late Fauré – four songs, including Reflets dans l’eau and Danseuse – the duo steer gracefully to atmospheric ballads by Debussy’s friend André Caplet, spiky Arthur Honegger miniatures and Ravel in Spanish mood (Don Quichotte à Dulcinée). Williams’s own idiomatic, semi-declamatory Verlaine settings, &lt;em&gt;Les ténèbres de l’amour&lt;/em&gt; (1994), form an effective bridge to more Honegger, Poulenc and, in perfect conclusion, Debussy’s Beau Soir.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/15/mirages-the-art-of-french-song-roderick-williams-roger-vignoles-review-ennio-morricone-cinema-suites-violin-orchestra"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Brahms: Complete Songs Vol 1 – Opp 32, 43, 86 and 105 review | Andrew Clements's classical album of the week</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/13/brahms-complete-songs-vol-1-opp-32-43-86-and-105-review-masterful-and-revelatory-interpretation</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christoph Prégardien/Ulrich Eisenlohr&lt;br&gt;(Naxos)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Tenor Christoph Prégardien gives an intelligent and perfectly weighted performance with pianist Ulrich Eisenlohr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade and more, no Lieder recitals have given me more intense pleasure than those by the tenor Christoph Prégardien. Though he is now in his mid 60s, and his voice has inevitably lost some of its former bloom and flexibility with age, this Brahms disc, recorded in 2020, confirms that the sheer intelligence of Prégardien’s performances, his immaculate diction and the perfect weight and colour he gives to each phrase, still conjure revelatory interpretations from everything he sings. The collection sees the start of what Naxos plans to be a complete survey of Brahms’s songs. How much of the series will be allotted to Prégardien isn’t clear, but with Ulrich Eisenlohr as his partner, the communicative power and mastery of every nuance of this opening instalment make one hope that the pair will be regularly involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four groups of songs cover almost a quarter of a century in Brahms’s development, from the nine songs of Op 32, completed in 1864, to the five of Op 105, which date to 1888. As Eisenlohr points out in his very thorough sleeve notes, the poems that Brahms set are rarely of the highest class – in that respect he differed in his approach to Lieder writing from his 19th-century predecessors, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/franz-schubert"&gt;Schubert&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/robert-schumann"&gt;Schumann&lt;/a&gt;; Gottfried Keller and Theodor Storm are probably the best known of the writers represented here. But each of these sets mixes and matches material from a variety of sources: Op 32, for instance, juxtaposes German translations of the 14th-century Persian lyric poet &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/sep/15/worlddispatch.iran"&gt;Hafez&lt;/a&gt; with poems by the early Romantic August von Platen-Hallermünde, while Op 43 includes a text from Des Knaben Wunderhorn, the folk collection that Mahler would later explore so extensively.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/13/brahms-complete-songs-vol-1-opp-32-43-86-and-105-review-masterful-and-revelatory-interpretation"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Francesca Chiejina: the radiant soprano who wants opera for all</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/30/francesca-chiejina-the-radiant-soprano-who-wants-opera-for-all</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Born in Lagos and raised in the US, she swapped medical training for arias – and has learned to embrace the pressure of being a leading voice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francesca Chiejina &lt;a href="https://www.rayfieldallied.com/news/2021/a-velvety-and-haunting-portrayal-francesca-chiejina-receives-glowing-reviews-as-miss-jessel-in-operaglass-works-production-of-the-turn-of-the-screw"&gt;began her year as a ghost&lt;/a&gt;, ended it as an &lt;a href="https://englishtouringopera.org.uk/productions/amadigi"&gt;enchantress&lt;/a&gt;, and took in a &lt;a href="https://www.birminghamopera.org.uk/wagners-rhinegold"&gt;goddess&lt;/a&gt;, a princess, a pauper and an &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000zgfd/bbc-proms-2021-john-wilson-and-the-sinfonia-of-london"&gt;acclaimed Proms appearance&lt;/a&gt; along the way. Covid might have meant an enforced pause for many musicians, but it certainly doesn’t seem to have derailed this radiant and versatile soprano. “Yeah,” she smiles, “I’ve had a crazy year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nigerian/American singer, 30, has been based in London since 2014, studying at &lt;a href="https://www.gsmd.ac.uk/"&gt;Guildhall&lt;/a&gt; and then winning a place on the Royal Opera House’s prestigious &lt;a href="https://www.roh.org.uk/about/jette-parker-young-artists-programme"&gt;Jette Parker Young Artists programme&lt;/a&gt;. We talk over Zoom as she’s in Nigeria for her first visit in more than three years. “It’s lovely to be here,” she says. “Being on the same soil where I was born. I’ve been reflecting a lot, re-remembering and rediscovering who I was, who I am and who I want to be.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/30/francesca-chiejina-the-radiant-soprano-who-wants-opera-for-all"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Jonas Kaufmann: ‘Opera can’t stand still. We are not bearers of a museum piece. It has to be alive’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/10/jonas-kaufmann-if-this-goes-on-much-further-we-will-soon-have-to-close-theatres</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The greatest tenor of his generation talks cancel culture, booing fans, and problematic roles&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘I don’t want a lot for Christmas,” whispers Jonas Kaufmann into my ears. “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCSKvXs_f9Q&amp;amp;t=21s"&gt;Make my wish come true / All I want for Christmas is you&lt;/a&gt;.” I don’t know whether to laugh or hit shuffle. It’s three hours before my interview with the world’s most celebrated singer, a man with a voice as golden as Pavarotti’s but with Hollywood looks, and I’m preparing by listening to a Kaufmann mixtape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 52-year-old’s peerless voice still in my ears, I stroll through Naples towards Teatro di San Carlo – the world’s oldest continuously active opera house, and where last night he sang Verdi’s Otello. His is a voice built for Italian opera: “I have a German passport,” he once said, “but an Italian voice.” The New Yorker critic &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/11/01/jonas-kaufmanns-gilded-voice" title=""&gt;Alex Ross described it&lt;/a&gt; as having a baritonal strength in the lower register, cleanly struck high notes (including a top C in Otello), a tenderly shimmering mid-range – all laced together in a luxurious legato.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/10/jonas-kaufmann-if-this-goes-on-much-further-we-will-soon-have-to-close-theatres"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Peter Brathwaite: ‘I’m taking it into my own hands to tell stories of our shared history’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/16/peter-brathwaite-im-taking-it-into-my-own-hands-to-tell-stories-of-our-shared-history</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As he rehearses a new children’s show at the Royal Opera House, the baritone recalls how he put lockdown to good use bringing Black history to Instagram&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baritone &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/may/12/robert-mcferrin-baritone-metropolitan-opera-peter-brathwaite" title=""&gt;Peter Brathwaite&lt;/a&gt; is in his happy place: the rehearsal room. Just now he is working with the company, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/27/little-bulb-natural-born-lyres" title=""&gt;Little Bulb&lt;/a&gt;, that’s devising the Royal Opera House’s family Christmas show, &lt;a href="https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/wolf-witch-giant-fairy-by-little-bulb-details?gclid=Cj0KCQiAtJeNBhCVARIsANJUJ2FtWY0wpAtX3d_RSFpmgBuAwAhrU7iYCeF5V65dLxDzXZga9HWxI0EaAnYiEALw_wcB"&gt;Wolf Witch Giant Fairy&lt;/a&gt;. It is based on Little Red Riding Hood, but with other fairy stories ingeniously embedded. Like all the best shows about enchantment, the magic is also theatrical: it is the sorcery of an actor turning into a witch or a cat just by putting on a mask; it’s the alchemy of a multitalented cast slipping apparently effortlessly from singing to playing instruments to acting. Brathwaite is the frock-coated narrator. It is very different from working on an operatic classic. With Little Bulb, much of the show is being created in the room. “It’s really democratic,” he says. “Yesterday, we all stood around together, dissecting one of the songs, discussing all the various ways it could develop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covid-19 has made such moments even more precious; Brathwaite, like thousands of other freelancers in the arts, saw his livelihood collapse as the pandemic took hold last year. His last performances before the first lockdown were of Songs of Arrival, a show he put together about the music of Jewish immigrants arriving in 1940s Manchester. Brathwaite grew up in the city’s Cheetham Hill, went to a majority Jewish primary school, and says he feels strong solidarity with “people who are likely to have been othered in their lives. My street was full of people from all over the world, and that has really influenced my desire to tell stories from all perspectives.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/16/peter-brathwaite-im-taking-it-into-my-own-hands-to-tell-stories-of-our-shared-history"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Singer Jamie Barton: ‘I’m not interested in roles created by the patriarchy any more’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/02/mezzo-soprano-jamie-barton-interview-erica-jeal</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;She waved the Pride flag at the Last Night of the Proms and sang in a gender-fluid Carmen. Now the mezzo-soprano is on a mission to take toxic masculinity out of opera&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when the classical music world fell in love with Jamie Barton. Perhaps it was the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/24/bbc-cardiff-singer-of-the-world-final-review"&gt;2013 Cardiff Singer of the World competition&lt;/a&gt;, when as an up-and-coming mezzo-soprano from Rome, Georgia, she carried off both first prize and the song prize – the first woman to do so. It was certainly a full-blown affair by the time of the 2019 Last Night of the Proms, when, dressed in the blue, pink and purple of the bisexual pride flag, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-49704831"&gt;she gleefully brandished a rainbow flag on stage&lt;/a&gt; as she sang Rule, Britannia!. And to be in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/01/jamie-barton-review-wigmore-hall-london-kathleen-kelly"&gt;her Wigmore Hall recital that autumn&lt;/a&gt; was to witness an audience reaction inspired not by mere affection or respect, but by actual love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, it’s the morning of Thanksgiving, and while her family back home in the US are preparing to celebrate, she is getting over jetlag in an apartment in Amsterdam. This year, she wouldn’t have it any other way – as for so many of her colleagues in the music world, the chance to work internationally again is worthy of its own celebration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/02/mezzo-soprano-jamie-barton-interview-erica-jeal"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Without Ethel Smyth and classical music's forgotten women, we only tell half the story</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/02/ethel-smyth-classical-music-forgotten-women-canon-composition</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Expanding the classical canon brings us incredible music and extraordinary stories, not least that of Ethel Smyth, whose compositions and pioneering energy filled England in the interwar years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1934, all of musical England gathered to celebrate the 75th birthday of one the country’s most famous composers – Dame Ethel Smyth. During a festival spanning several months, audiences crowded into the Queen’s Hall, London, to hear her symphonic cantata The Prison, or settled in at home to listen to the BBC broadcasts of her work. At the festival’s final concert in the Royal Albert Hall, the composer sat beside Queen Mary to watch Sir Thomas Beecham conduct her Mass. By this point, Smyth was nearly completely deaf, and could barely hear a note of her own music. But she could understand the uproarious applause that surrounded her when the concert ended, acknowledging the lifetime she had given to music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her death in 1944, Smyth spent several decades out of the limelight, but she is now coming back on to concert programmes and recording schedules. The CD release that blew me away this year was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/06/ethel-smyth-the-prison-review-brailey-burton-experiential-orchestra"&gt;Chandos’s world premiere recording of The Prison,&lt;/a&gt; delivering stellar performances from Dashon Burton, Sarah Brailey, James Blachly and the Experiential Orchestra and Chorus. And Smyth is not alone in enjoying a resurgence of interest. Thanks to decades of work by campaigners, performers, and musicologists, diversity is now firmly on musicians’ agendas. There’s still a lot of work to be done, but it feels as if we might be reaching a turning point. The &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000n18w"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.classicfm.com/radio/shows-presenters/chi-chis-classical-champions/"&gt;Classic FM&lt;/a&gt; have been running programmes about composers of colour, &lt;a href="https://www.faber.co.uk/blog/faber-acquires-new-landmark-alternative-history-of-twentieth-century-music-by-kate-molleson/"&gt;publishers&lt;/a&gt; are turning their attention to figures currently absent from their catalogues, and both #MeToo and Black Lives Matter have led to institutions being held to account on their commitments to gender and racial equality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/02/ethel-smyth-classical-music-forgotten-women-canon-composition"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
