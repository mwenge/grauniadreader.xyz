      <title>Lata Mangeshkar obituary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/07/lata-mangeshkar-obituary</link>
      <description>One of India’s most famous playback singers hailed as ‘the nightingale of Bollywood’ who had a four-octave vocal range&lt;p&gt;Lata Mangeshkar, “the nightingale of Bollywood”, who has died aged 92 after contracting Covid-19, was a much-loved Indian national and international figure, whose songs provided the backdrop to the lives of millions for seven decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music sung by her was heard constantly across India, in shops, restaurants, taxis or on the radio, and she became known as “Didi”, or sister, because so many people identified with her often emotional songs. And yet she was best known as a playback singer, a vocalist who does not appear onscreen but provides the soundtrack for films in which actors lip sync to her singing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/07/lata-mangeshkar-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>James Wharram obituary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/feb/04/james-wharram-obituary</link>
      <description>Catamaran boatbuilder, Atlantic sailor and adventurer with an unconventional family life&lt;p&gt;On 27 September 1955, James Wharram &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t72lKIpb3VY" title=""&gt;set sail from Falmouth&lt;/a&gt; in a 23½ft flat-bottomed double canoe (now called a catamaran) that he had built himself at a cost of £200, with no engine, and none of the electronic navigation equipment today’s sailors take for granted. His quest was to cross the Atlantic, in order to prove that such a vessel, the ancient craft of the Polynesians, was an oceanworthy one. The boat was called Tangaroa, after the Polynesian god of the sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Wharram, who has died aged 93, were two German women, Jutta Schultze-Rhonhof and Ruth Merseburger, both of whom he was romantically involved with. “They were very happy to share ‘their man’,” he wrote. “There was no jealousy.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/feb/04/james-wharram-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Uschi Gatward obituary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/03/uschi-gatward-obituary</link>
      <description>Writer whose collection of short stories, English Magic, showed how the apparently mundane could be imbued with significance&lt;p&gt;Though Uschi Gatward, who has died aged 49 of cancer, produced just a single collection of short stories, it proved to be a remarkably effective one. English Magic (2021) is a book with an atmosphere of its own, the whole greater than the sum of its parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first story, The Clinic, opens with a deceptively simple declaration: “It’s set up to look like a home, with sofas and a coffee table, but nobody’s fooled.” Immediately, the familiar becomes discomfiting. From there, the straightforward reality of taking a toddler to a clinic becomes a disturbing whirl of paranoia, state surveillance and societal disapproval. Soon the toddler’s family is fighting for survival – heading out for the wilderness after buying camping supplies in a shop where even the plastic mannequins are ominous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/03/uschi-gatward-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Francis Jackson obituary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/03/francis-jackson-obituary</link>
      <description>Organist and composer of Anglican sacred music with a secret love of big bands&lt;p&gt;The organist and composer Francis Jackson, who has died aged 104, began his career as a chorister under the distinguished organist of York Minster &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6JfInyQI9Q" title=""&gt;Edward Bairstow&lt;/a&gt;. Jackson was still active as both performer and composer 90 years later, having been organist himself at the minster for three and a half decades (1946–82). A &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yFFZa6fOhY" title=""&gt;virtuoso executant&lt;/a&gt; and prolific composer, he bestrode the world of English church music as a powerful if traditional force throughout the second half of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His large output of Anglican sacred music included the frequently used &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F-eTi-0U_M" title=""&gt;Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis in G&lt;/a&gt; (“Me in G” as he liked to refer to the setting), hymn-tunes such as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDi_yMh0XOY" title=""&gt;East Acklam&lt;/a&gt;, sung to the words of For the Fruits of His Creation at harvest time, and anthems. The six organ sonatas are the most substantial of his works in that genre, though there were &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuwpndwS3p0" title=""&gt;many other pieces&lt;/a&gt; that both reflected his heritage of Bairstow, Herbert Howells and Edward Elgar, as well as his love of Ravel and admiration for Paul Hindemith and Max Reger. In addition to the church music he wrote a symphony, an organ concerto, chamber music, songs and a pair of monodramas with narrator. His compositional style was generally a conservative one, more modernistic neoclassical traits held in counterpoise with Romantic tendencies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/03/francis-jackson-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Actor in the high-spirited Footlights revue Cambridge Circus in the 1960s who was a founding cast member of Emmerdale Farm&lt;p&gt;The actor Jo Kendall, who has died aged 81, was catapulted to fame as the only woman alongside a group of six male Cambridge University students – including John Cleese, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/13/tim-brooke-taylor-obituary" title=""&gt;Tim Brooke-Taylor&lt;/a&gt; and Bill Oddie – in a revue that wowed the critics in the West End of London and transferred to Broadway in the early 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decade later, she spoke the first words in the television soap Emmerdale Farm (now titled Emmerdale), in the role of Peggy Skilbeck, Annie Sugden’s daughter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/03/jo-kendall-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Monica Vitti obituary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/02/monica-vitti-obituary</link>
      <description>Star of Michelangelo Antonioni’s films in the 1960s who later turned to light comedies&lt;p&gt;Although she was often described, perhaps with a touch of irony, as the “muse of incommunicability” for her dramatic roles in several of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/aug/01/guardianobituaries.obituaries" title=""&gt;Michelangelo Antonioni&lt;/a&gt;’s films, Monica Vitti, who has died aged 90, always aspired to be a comic actor. In 1962, she had an offer to do a film for &lt;a href="https://amp.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/29/agnes-varda-obituary" title=""&gt;Agnès Varda&lt;/a&gt;, but turned it down; as she explained in an interview, “I want to remain loyal to Michelangelo, who has promised to make me the Carole Lombard of the second half of the century.” Though Vitti certainly had comparable looks and verve, and did eventually succeed in becoming a popular comedic star, she will probably remain in most film buffs’ minds as Giuliana, the complicated young blond woman in Antonioni’s Il Deserto Rosso (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/26/red-desert-review" title=""&gt;Red Desert&lt;/a&gt;, 1964), his first colour feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giuliana was perhaps Vitti’s most credible and identifiable characterisation. Her main concern is for her child’s neurosis, but she is not helped by her anguished attempt at a romantic relationship with an engineer, played by &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2002/oct/28/guardianobituaries.arts" title=""&gt;Richard Harris&lt;/a&gt;. The film contains one of world cinema’s most bizarre lines: “My hair hurts”, but it probably aroused merriment only when seen translated in a subtitle – Tonino Guerra, the film’s co-writer, pointed out that in Italian it sounds better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/02/monica-vitti-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Lord fearn obituary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/feb/02/lord-fearn-obituary</link>
      <description>Liberal politician, committed activist and natural performer who maintained a lifelong involvement in amateur dramatics&lt;p&gt;Ronnie Fearn, Lord Fearn, who has died aged 90, was the former MP for Southport, Merseyside, and a most unusual politician. He succeeded in winning elections despite confounding almost all the expectations of modern formulaic politics and, without being a conventional intellectual Liberal, he was the ultimate party loyalist and committed activist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before joining the Liberal party in Southport in early 1961, he had written to the local newspaper complaining about the Conservative council cutting grants to youth organisations – a cause to which he had a lifelong commitment – and he stated then that he only had “slight political leanings”. These nevertheless became enough to draw him into 60 years of Liberal campaigning. He won his local ward, Norwood, for the Southport council in 1963 and he held this seat through every change of name and local government reorganisation for 52 years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/feb/02/lord-fearn-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Keri Hulme obituary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/01/keri-hulme-obituary</link>
      <description>New Zealand author who won the Booker prize in 1985 for her novel the bone people, and also wrote poetry and short stories&lt;p&gt;The writer &lt;a href="https://www.read-nz.org/writer/hulme-keri/" title=""&gt;Keri Hulme&lt;/a&gt;, who has died aged 74, was the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/dec/28/keri-hulme-booker-prize-new-zealand-writer-dies-74" title=""&gt;first New Zealander to win the Booker prize&lt;/a&gt;, in 1985, for the bone people (as she chose to style the title), and the first person to win for their debut novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keri had recently received the Pegasus prize for Māori literature and was in the US on a promotional tour when the Booker ceremony took place in London. Representatives from her publishers, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/spiral-collectives" title=""&gt;Spiral Collectives&lt;/a&gt;, extended a &lt;em&gt;karanga &lt;/em&gt;(formal greeting) and accepted the award on her behalf. Keri’s own response, in a phonecall with the literary critic Hermione Lee, was: “You’re pulling my leg. Bloody hell.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/01/keri-hulme-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Leonard Fenton obituary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/01/leonard-fenton-obituary</link>
      <description>Actor who performed in Beckett’s Happy Days and played the genial GP on EastEnders for 34 years&lt;p&gt;Leonard Fenton, who has died aged 95, was approaching 60 when he joined the original cast of EastEnders in 1985 as Dr Harold Legg, the friendly Jewish GP and much-loved pillar of the community. He continued in the BBC soap for 34 years, appearing in more than 250 episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The character was six years older than Fenton and widowed during the second world war when his wife was killed by a bomb. He was already at retirement age in the first episode, but he continued to serve the fictional Walford’s residents – and enjoy reminiscences with Dot Cotton (June Brown), Ethel Skinner (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/jul/14/broadcasting.guardianobituaries" title=""&gt;Gretchen Franklin&lt;/a&gt;) and Lou Beale (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jul/11/anna-wing-lou-beale-eastenders" title=""&gt;Anna Wing&lt;/a&gt;). In the serial’s early days, he helped Sue Osman (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/10/sandy-ratcliff-obituary" title=""&gt;Sandy Ratcliff&lt;/a&gt;) come to terms with the cot death of her baby and humoured the hypochondriacal Dot. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/01/leonard-fenton-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Galina Samsova obituary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/31/galina-samsova-obituary</link>
      <description>Ballet dancer with a distinctive Russian style who was noted for her musicality and acting ability&lt;p&gt;Galina Samsova, who has died aged 84, was a ballerina with a distinctive Russian style, who was acclaimed in the west at a time when few Soviet-trained dancers were performing there. A radiant and musical dancer, Samsova was noted for her soaring jump, her stunningly eloquent and pliable back, her rich port de bras and her acting ability. Once seen she was not forgotten, despite lacking the advantages of a traditional ballerina’s body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only was Samsova a great dancer but she was also a generous person, ever ready to help her colleagues and young dancers. She was loved and respected by those she worked with, and in the last three decades was in demand as a judge at international ballet competitions. It was through seeing talented young dancers in competitions that she brought, for example, the Czech Daria Klimentová and Spanish Tamara Rojo to Scottish Ballet, where in the 1990s she served as artistic director, launching their careers in Britain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/31/galina-samsova-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2022/feb/07/frances-seeley-obituary</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My mother, Frances Seeley, who has died aged 85 after a stroke, was a primary school teacher who was involved in training staff across Coventry in the Standard Attainment Tests (SATs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The daughter of Florence (nee Weaver) and Oliver Smith, Frances was born in Uckfield, East Sussex, where her parents were in service. During the second world war, her father was away from home with the army for five years and was awarded the Military Medal. The family moved to Coventry, where Frances spent the night of the blitz under a staircase at home, as her baby brother, Robert, had chicken pox and and the family could not get to their shelter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2022/feb/07/frances-seeley-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My husband Mike Jackson, who has died aged 73 following a long illness, had a distinguished career as a full-time official of the public sector union Nupe, and later of Unison.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My mother, Karen Walton, who has died aged 85, loved art and literature, and was passionate about animal welfare, equality and trees. She was loving, creative, intelligent, infuriating and chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in Dulwich, south London, to parents who were also creative – a painter and camouflage artist, Henry Hoyland, and a poet and puppet-maker, Margret (nee Mitchell-Withers) – she had an eccentric childhood with her sister, Rosemary. By the time Karen was 12, both her parents had died of cancer and she was bought up by her aunt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/06/karen-walton-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/06/andy-ross-obituary</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My friend Andy Ross, who has died aged 65 after treatment for cancer, was a hugely respected music industry executive. He worked with some of the biggest names in the business and was instrumental in the famous Blur vs Oasis chart battle in the 1990s, when the Britpop bands released new singles on the same day in a race for the No 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The elder son of Ian Ross, a draughtsman in the oil industry, and Marlene (nee Bates, now Williamson), a secretary at the London Management entertainment company, Andy was born in Upper Norwood, south London, and gained a scholarship to Dulwich college. He and I met in 1977 in Leicester, where he was studying social and economic history at the university, while I was at the poly. His band the Disco Zombies were looking for a singer and I was looking for a band.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/06/andy-ross-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Letter: Sibghat Kadri obituary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/feb/03/letter-sibghat-kadri-obituary</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 1971 Immigration Act was a novel and complex piece of legislation. As a young barrister, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2021/dec/07/sibghat-kadri-obituary" title=""&gt;Sibghat Kadri&lt;/a&gt; argued a number of the early cases on it, seeking to humanise it so far as feasible. After he argued one of these cases before the lord chief justice’s court (a pretty intimidating forum), the government’s standing counsel, Gordon Slynn, said to me that Sibghat’s was by far the best argument he had heard on the legislation’s meaning and effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sibghat’s characteristic response, when I told him, was: “He can afford to say that. He won.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/feb/03/letter-sibghat-kadri-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Letter: Jack Dromey obituary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/02/letter-jack-dromey-obituary</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/09/jack-dromey-obituary" title=""&gt;Jack Dromey&lt;/a&gt; knew how to make things happen and capture public attention, as I found out when working alongside him at the TGWU. When the union was seeking to improve the pay and conditions of cleaners in government buildings including the offices of the secret services, the Sun headlined the story “The name’s Mop – Mrs Mop”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also did much on behalf of refuse and other workers when councils transferred their services to outside employers. The landmark victory secured then has protected many thousands of workers since.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/02/letter-jack-dromey-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Letter: Richard Leakey obituary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/28/letter-richard-leakey-obituary</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Through my father, Kenneth Oakley, a palaeontologist most famous for helping expose the Piltdown skull hoax, I met all manner of distinguished scientists and other significant figures, but none made as much impression as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/03/richard-leakey-obituary" title=""&gt;Richard Leakey&lt;/a&gt;, and that was when he was just a kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leakey’s parents, Louis and Mary, had been invited to lunch at our home in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, and a somewhat resistant Richard had been brought along in tow. A couple of years older than me, he ignored me completely, but I could see even then that he had charisma and would go far.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/28/letter-richard-leakey-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Letter: Lord Myners obituary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/25/letter-lord-myners-obituary</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unlike most city grandees, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/16/lord-myners-obituary" title=""&gt;Paul Myners&lt;/a&gt; was a consistent advocate of social change. Last year a small group of us, volunteers campaigning to protect the BBC and public service broadcasting, went to him for help and advice, and he agreed to chair the &lt;a href="https://britishbroadcastingchallenge.com/" title=""&gt;British Broadcasting Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The venture benefited immeasurably from his incisive intelligence, the speed of his decision-making, and his conviction that the government had to be stopped from wrecking a great British institution. He was fearless, asking embarrassing questions in the House of Lords and using freedom of information (FOI) inquiries with relish. He thought it was the right thing to do and we miss him very much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/25/letter-lord-myners-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>André Leon Talley obituary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/20/andre-leon-talley-obituary</link>
      <description>Journalist, creative force and editor-at-large of US Vogue who enjoyed a unique personal status in the fashion world&lt;p&gt;André Leon Talley loved the surprisingly similar rituals of two ways of life he knew well: the black community of his childhood in North Carolina, and French couture, with its historical and literary associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His remarkable persona and work as fashion editor, adviser and seer were founded on church ladies in their Sunday best, and an encyclopedic knowledge of the history of clothes. Few couturiers knew a fraction of what he did, and the US Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who appointed him her shield – even in heels she stood small beside his 6ft 6in – admitted that he had what she lacked, a deep apprehension of fashion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/20/andre-leon-talley-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>April Ashley obituary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/19/april-ashley-obituary</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Model, dancer and socialite who was one of the earliest people to undergo gender realignment surgery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of April Ashley’s 86 years were the hard going of a pioneer’s life, with repeated rejection and scandal-blighted reverses. But she never regretted the day in 1960 when she risked her life to become her true self through gender realignment surgery, among the earliest to undertake such a thing. The operation cost her prolonged pain, besides a difficult-to-raise £2,500, but in old age she said that every morning there was “still a bit of joy left” at the memory of the transformation. As to tough times: “Chins up … be as brave as you can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her beauty, instinctual style and understanding of the artifice of glamour pre-dated the surgery. After it, she briefly had chances as a model, projecting a 1950s soignee manner animated by a new naughtiness; she had an aristo voice and native scouse wit, too. David Bailey, Brian Duffy and Terences Donovan and O’Neill photographed her, even in lingerie; she didn’t hide who she was and how she had become so, and they didn’t care, as Ashley delivered a great picture. She updated her image through life – kook, 60s socialite, private-life professional, and in her late years, carefully edited duchess. Few have ever carried off with grace the gown and squishy headgear of an academic honour, but she did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/19/april-ashley-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Ronnie Spector obituary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/13/ronnie-spector-obituary</link>
      <description>Lead singer with the Ronettes, the 1960s girl group whose smash hits included Be My Baby&lt;p&gt;The combination of the voice of Veronica Bennett, who has died aged 78, and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/17/phil-spector-obituary" title=""&gt;Phil Spector&lt;/a&gt;’s studio-built Wall of Sound became one of the most potent and distinctive sounds to emerge from the fast-changing world of pop music in the early 1960s. Ronnie Spector, as she became when she and the producer married, was the lead singer of the Ronettes, a New York trio whose hits included &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSPpbOGnFgk" title=""&gt;Be My Baby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkoa81kvNf8" title=""&gt;Baby I Love You&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K04WwAL-3eg" title=""&gt;(The Best Part of) Breakin’ Up&lt;/a&gt; and – her own favourite – &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBBys5TLxCI" title=""&gt;Walking in the Rain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With their towering black beehive hairdos, extravagant eye makeup and tight sheath dresses, the Ronettes brought a whiff of sex and danger to the wholesome girl-group genre of the early 60s, previously dominated by the romantic songs of the Shirelles, the Chiffons and the Cookies. The sisters Veronica and Estelle Bennett and their cousin Nedra Talley projected an image that was a long way from any parent’s idea of a perfect prom date.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/13/ronnie-spector-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>American opera singer with a mesmerising stage presence admired for her acting as well as her voice&lt;p&gt;The American opera singer Maria Ewing, who has died aged 71, excited both acclaim and controversy for her seductive portrayals and frequently idiosyncratic vocal delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of her early career was made in the US, initially under the mentorship of the Metropolitan Opera’s music director &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/mar/18/james-levine-obituary" title=""&gt;James Levine&lt;/a&gt;, though British audiences will recall more readily the vivid performances she gave of several roles, most notably Rosina (The Barber of Seville), Carmen and Poppea (Monteverdi’s L’Incoronazione di Poppea), the last two directed by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/12/peter-hall-obituary-british-theatre-rss-national" title=""&gt;Sir Peter Hall&lt;/a&gt;, whom she married in 1982.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/12/maria-ewing-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Jack Dromey obituary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/09/jack-dromey-obituary</link>
      <description>Leading trade unionist and Labour politician respected across party lines&lt;p&gt;Jack Dromey, who has died suddenly aged 73, was one of the leading trade unionists of his generation and a Labour politician. He was elected MP for Birmingham Erdington in 2010 and sat on his party’s frontbench for all but a few months of his parliamentary career. His working life was devoted to the interests of union members and later to those of the people he represented in the House of Commons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dynamic and energetic man, he constantly sought a way forward in pursuit of whichever cause he was seeking to advance, yet he always tried to build a coalition of opinion in order to do so. In consequence, he was both immensely successful in his trade union and political campaigns and simultaneously won widespread respect, even from those who did not share his political opinions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/09/jack-dromey-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Sidney Poitier obituary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/07/sidney-poitier-obituary</link>
      <description>Oscar-winning actor who starred in To Sir, With Love, and broke down racial barriers in Hollywood and beyond&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sidney Poitier, who has died aged 94, was the first black actor to win an Oscar in a leading role, in 1964, for his performance in Lilies of the Field. This simple story about a handyman helping German nuns build a chapel in Arizona was enhanced by its star’s humour and vitality. It led to a string of successes – To Sir, With Love, In the Heat of the Night and Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner (all 1967) – which made Poitier a box-office star and consolidated his growing fame and wealth. But Poitier’s greatest achievement – alongside his friend and occasional rival &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/harry-belafonte" title=""&gt;Harry Belafonte&lt;/a&gt; – was to help alter the racial perceptions that dominated not just Hollywood, but also society in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His success came against seemingly insurmountable odds. He was born two months prematurely into extreme poverty in Miami, where his Bahamian parents, Evelyn (nee Outten) and Reginald Poitier, had gone to sell their tomato crop. The family remained in the US for three months before returning to Cat Island, where Sidney spent his early childhood. They moved to Nassau in a vain search for a better life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/07/sidney-poitier-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Peter Bogdanovich obituary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/07/peter-bogdanovich-obituary</link>
      <description>Director whose films including The Last Picture Show and Paper Moon lovingly evoked the Hollywood past&lt;p&gt;Peter Bogdanovich, who has died aged 82, was among the few examples of a film director whose career rocketed spectacularly at its beginning before it soon plunged to earth. His third feature (after two neophyte efforts), &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/apr/14/the-last-picture-show-review" title=""&gt;The Last Picture Show (1971)&lt;/a&gt;, was nominated for eight Academy Awards, and won two. The film that followed, What’s Up, Doc? (1972), was a massive box-office hit, which grossed a healthy $28m for Warner Bros. On a winning streak, Bogdanovich achieved a hat-trick with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/12/courtney-hunt-paper-moon-ryan-tatum-oneal" title=""&gt;Paper Moon (1973)&lt;/a&gt;, which was not only a commercial and critical success, but won a best supporting actress Oscar for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/aug/28/tatum-oneal-ryan-found-interview" title=""&gt;Tatum O’Neal&lt;/a&gt; who, at 10, was the youngest ever recipient of the award. It seemed that Bogdanovich could do no wrong. But then came Daisy Miller (1974), which received mainly bad reviews, and was followed by further flops and personal upheavals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He bore it all with equanimity (externally, at least), making cameo appearances in friends’ films and TV shows – nicely dry in the role of Dr Elliot Kupferberg, Tony Soprano’s therapist’s therapist in the hit series The Sopranos (2000-07) – cropping up regularly on documentaries, commenting wittily on film directors and directing films himself from time to time, though he never returned to the glory days.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/07/peter-bogdanovich-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Richard Leakey obituary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/03/richard-leakey-obituary</link>
      <description>Kenyan conservationist, politician and fossil hunter who promoted Africa as the birthplace of mankind&lt;p&gt;Richard Leakey, who has died aged 77, called his 1983 autobiography One Life, perhaps because the rest of us might have thought more than one person must have been involved in such varied activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a celebrated fossil discoverer, notably of early hominids; a museum director; a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2004/oct/07/environment.comment" title=""&gt;wildlife conservationist&lt;/a&gt; and enemy of poachers; a politician, founding his own Safina party; and an excellent fundraiser, never short of projects on which to spend the money. To many outsiders, he was the most famous Kenyan of them all. To Kenyans, he was both skilful thorn and prickly hero.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/03/richard-leakey-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Betty White obituary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/02/betty-white-obituary</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Veteran American actor who played Rose in the hit TV comedy show The Golden Girls &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although she will be best remembered for playing the naive Rose Nylund in the hit comedy The Golden Girls (1985-92), Betty White, who has died aged 99, was for seven decades one of the best-loved performers on US television, a consummate professional who won eight Emmy awards, the first and last separated by more than 60 years. She was also a pioneer, in the 1950s one of the first women producing television, and, 30 years later, the first female game show host, dubbed a “femcee”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All four lead actors on The Golden Girls won best actress Emmys, but White’s came first, in 1986. This may be because she played against type; Rose was the opposite of her role on the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/25/mary-tyler-moore-obituary" title=""&gt;Mary Tyler Moore&lt;/a&gt; Show, as Sue Ann Nivens (1973-77), who hid her conniving nature beneath a sugary surface, while performing as the Happy Homemaker at the TV station where Mary worked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/02/betty-white-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Broadcaster and DJ who was the first woman to have her own weekday show on Radio 1 and be a regular host of Top of the Pops&lt;p&gt;The DJ Janice Long, who has died aged 66 following a short illness, became a pioneer in broadcasting as the first woman to have her own weekday show on BBC Radio 1 and the first to become a regular presenter of Top of the Pops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike some of the prominent DJs with whom she shared the airwaves during the first part of her career in the 1980s, Long was a genuine music fan, credited with giving a helping hand to a number of artists whom she had championed, including Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Primal Scream, Manic Street Preachers, the Teardrop Explodes, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jul/23/amy-winehouse-obituary" title=""&gt;Amy Winehouse&lt;/a&gt; and the Coral.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/27/janice-long-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Raymond Illingworth obituary</title>

      <description>Off-spinning all-rounder whose flair for captaincy enabled England to win and retain the Ashes against Australia&lt;p&gt;Raymond Illingworth, who has died aged 89, was one of England’s most successful cricket captains, leading his side to a series victory in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/australia-cricket-team" title=""&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;, in 1970-71, and then retaining &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ashes" title=""&gt;the Ashes&lt;/a&gt; at home, in 1972. A tough Yorkshireman and an all-rounder who gave nothing away with either bat or ball, as a skipper Illingworth was a master of the meaningful bowling change or disconcerting field adjustment, and could often affect the course of a match just by ratcheting up the psychological pressure on the opposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was also a superb man-manager who could get the best out of even the most difficult characters by applying equal measures of empathy, common sense and firmhandedness. While he undoubtedly benefited from having a strong team to nurture – with players including Geoffrey Boycott, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/25/john-edrich-obituary" title=""&gt;John Edrich&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/nov/19/basil-doliveira" title=""&gt;Basil D’Oliveira&lt;/a&gt;, Derek Underwood and John Snow at his disposal – he also ensured that his players displayed tremendous spirit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/26/raymond-illingworth-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Joan Didion obituary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/23/joan-didion-obituary</link>
      <description>Detached observer of American society and political life through her collections of journalism, novels and screenwriting&lt;p&gt;The writing of Joan Didion, who has died 87, was mantra-like, mannered, even “set in its own modulations” (that was Martin Amis’s snipe). It was also unique and remarkable. Even the shape of her books was uncommon, the sentences spaced on pages as tall and narrow as king-sized cigarette packets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had practised that incantatory style since her mother had presented her, aged five, with a notebook and a suggestion that she calm her anxious self by writing. Her family had long been settled in California, then chiefly an agricultural state, a location that mattered to Didion’s story, and to her story-telling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/23/joan-didion-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
