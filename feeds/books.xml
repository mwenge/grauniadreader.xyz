      <title>The big idea: can foreign policy be feminist?</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/07/the-big-idea-can-foreign-policy-be-feminist</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tying gender to military intervention has often been disastrous. Is there another way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Laura Bush’s famous radio speech declaring that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/nov/17/afghanistan.september11" title=""&gt;the invasion of Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; would liberate its women, to the Trump administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/defense/event/after-the-deal-new-iran-strategy" title=""&gt;invocation&lt;/a&gt; of women’s rights as it pulled out of the nuclear deal with Iran, war-making in the modern world is often linked to gender equality. Those who push the west to take a muscular approach to advancing its interests in distant places, through bombing, droning or economic warfare, like to weave sepia-tinted images of women in miniskirts into their advocacy. Whatever the actual motives, accompanying them with rhetoric about securing women’s freedom has become standard practice during western interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cynical moves are often what come to mind when we hear the words “ethical foreign policy”. But a whole realm of quiet work lies beyond them. As it stands, much of western foreign policy is concerned with shoring up peace and stability in areas of strategic interest to governments. That includes dispatching advisers to improve developing countries’ militaries, supporting healthcare and education through development aid, and doing diplomatic work to get disagreeing parties to negotiate before things deteriorate too far. For years now, various governments have woven gender equality into these efforts. When development aid sits formally in the same department as foreign policy, as it now does in Britain, those efforts can get serious political backing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/07/the-big-idea-can-foreign-policy-be-feminist"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/07/margaret-atwood-joins-writers-calling-for-urgent-action-over-missing-rwandan-poet-innocent-bahati</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;More than 100 authors from around the world have written to the Rwandan president about the case of Innocent Bahati, who disappeared a year ago today&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margaret Atwood, Ben Okri and JM Coetzee have joined more than 100 writers from around the world in calling on the Rwandan president to intervene in the case of the poet Innocent Bahati, who disappeared one year ago today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to human rights organisation PEN International, Bahati was last seen at a hotel in Nyanza district, in the Southern Province of Rwanda, on 7 February 2021. The poet, who is well-known in Rwanda and had published poetry on YouTube and Facebook, as well as regularly performing at live events, failed to return to Kigali, and his phones have been switched off since.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/07/margaret-atwood-joins-writers-calling-for-urgent-action-over-missing-rwandan-poet-innocent-bahati"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Adults are banning books, but they’re not asking our opinions’: meet the teens of the Banned Book Club</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/07/banned-book-club-pennsylvania-animal-farm</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Conservatives are pushing to ban books from school libraries. At a time of crisis, a group of Pennsylvania teenagers are fighting back&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Napoleon’s use of the sheep was notable,” says Jordan Daughtry, 14. She’s clutching a copy of Animal Farm, and referring to the authoritarian Berkshire boar who seizes control of an English acreage, before bending his fellow animals to his will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sheep, who represent the unwitting masses in George Orwell’s critique of Joseph Stalin’s totalitarian rule, are “ignorant buffoons”, Daughtry says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiara Daughtry, left, and Lena Cackley.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/07/banned-book-club-pennsylvania-animal-farm"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jonson’s poetic response to bad reviews of his plays by ‘wolf’ and ‘ass’  praises poetry and urges a return to deeper sources of inspiration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Ode to Himself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where dost thou careless lie,&lt;br&gt;Buried in ease and sloth?&lt;br&gt;Knowledge that sleeps doth die;&lt;br&gt;And this security,&lt;br&gt;It is the common moth&lt;br&gt;That eats on wits and arts, and oft destroys them both.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2022/feb/07/poem-of-the-week-an-ode-to-himself-by-ben-jonson"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Our Country Friends by Gary Shteyngart review – Chekhov-inspired capers</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/07/our-country-friends-by-gary-shteyngart-review-chekhov-inspired-capers</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Old friends escape New York to sit out the pandemic in a Covid satire whose references don’t travel well&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have met people, mercifully few in number, who just don’t respond to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/chekhov"&gt;Chekhov&lt;/a&gt;. For me, his four main plays (&lt;em&gt;Uncle&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Vanya&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Cherry Orchard, The Seagull &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Three&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Sisters&lt;/em&gt;) are stone-cold masterpieces, timeless examinations of the human condition. But some people, slap them in the best seat in the stalls and they’ll ask what all the fuss is about: a whole lot of rich people complaining about nothing and achieving even less?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And perhaps now, with Gary Shteyngart’s latest book, I’m beginning to understand their bewilderment. &lt;em&gt;Our Country Friends&lt;/em&gt;, a Chekhov-inspired Covid novel, comes lauded with every form of praise from serious Americans, up to and including the word “masterpiece”. And yet here I am in the Crush Bar, staring into my G&amp;amp;T and wondering what I’m missing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/07/our-country-friends-by-gary-shteyngart-review-chekhov-inspired-capers"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>One Party After Another: The Disruptive Life of Nigel Farage review – the man who broke Britain</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/06/one-party-after-another-the-disruptive-life-of-nigel-farage-review-the-man-who-broke-britain</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Michael Crick’s gripping and vivid study of Mr Brexit is full of revelatory stories, but pulls its punches at the end&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As usual, he was acting the stunt. Early in the morning on the day of the 2010 election, Nigel Farage turned up at an airfield in Northamptonshire, near to the constituency he was contesting. He was wearing his typical pin-striped suit and a rosette in the plum-and-custard colours of his party. He boarded a two-seater plane, the idea being that it would trail a banner bearing the slogan “VOTE FOR YOUR COUNTRY – VOTE UKIP”. Farage wanted to fly in the passenger seat, even though no one would be able to see him from the ground and the TV companies never broadcast campaign stunts on polling day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can’t just stick a big banner on the back of a small aircraft. The plane had to take off, gain some height and then make a deep dive in order to use a grappling hook to grab the banner from between two poles. The pilot finally managed to attach the banner at the fifth attempt only for it to become entwined in the tail and rudder. The aircraft was soon plunging towards the earth at 80mph. “Oh fuck!” cried Farage. He closed his eyes just before impact, convinced he was about to die. The plane smashed into a field, nose first and inverted. When Farage opened his eyes, he was upside down, his face was almost touching the ground and his blood was dripping on to the grass. Another few inches and he would have been dead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/06/one-party-after-another-the-disruptive-life-of-nigel-farage-review-the-man-who-broke-britain"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Love Marriage by Monica Ali review – lurid turns and lashings of sex</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/06/love-marriage-by-monica-ali-review-lurid-turns-and-lashings-of-sex</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The novelist is on familiar territory and great form with a tale of premarital tension that punctures family life and feminism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A throwaway moment in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/monica-ali"&gt;Monica Ali&lt;/a&gt;’s new novel introduces us to a minor character, an unpublished young black author who, when he talks of struggling to sell his manuscript – a futuristic thriller about an eco-terrorist attack on a billionaire’s post-apocalyptic bolthole in New Zealand – finds himself told to try something “closer to home”; drop the sci-fi, in other words, and write about being black in Britain today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You sense Ali speaks of what she knows; born in Dhaka and raised in England, she has arguably spent her whole career to date wriggling in the jaws of publishing’s authenticity fetish. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/brick-lane-9780552771153"&gt;Brick Lane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, her bestselling 2003 debut about a Bangladeshi teenager’s arranged marriage in east London, earned her a reputation as a vital voice of multicultural Britain – which meant no one quite knew what to make of her next book, &lt;em&gt;Alentejo Blue&lt;/em&gt;, tales of village life in rural Portugal. She fared better with &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/02/monica-ali-in-the-kitchen"&gt;In the Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, about migrant labour in London; less so – putting it mildly - with the counterfactual shenanigans of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/02/untold-story-monica-ali-review"&gt;Untold Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, in which Princess Diana, fearing assassination, fakes her own death and relocates to the US after cosmetic surgery in Brazil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pattern – one novel a market-pleaser, the next a curious left turn – continues with Ali’s latest book, which is set in London in the wake of the Brexit vote and centres on Yasmin, a trainee doctor who is the daughter of Bengali immigrants. She’s about to marry her colleague, Joe, who lives with his subtly domineering mother, Harriet, a feminist academic still famous for posing nude in her 70s heyday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The setup starts off as giggly meet-the-parents comedy, with early laughs coming at the expense of the malapropisms and wonky grammar of Yasmin’s head-wobbling mother, Anisah, who mistakes a Howard Hodgkin painting on Harriet’s wall for a long-cherished childhood artwork by Joe. For his part, Joe faces embarrassment of his own when his mother’s self-congratulatory liberalism all but corners his fiancee into planning a Muslim wedding against her will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Ali pokes fun at the unwitting ironies of one-size-fits-all feminism, the easy gags soon give way to the drama of a busy plot rife with secrets and lies. Yasmin gets a shock when a nurse on her ward lifts the lid on Joe’s double life, foreshadowed in segments told from his therapist’s point of view. An even more seismic upset follows the revelation that her parents’ cross-class marriage was a murkier affair than let on by the family lore of an unarranged love match.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We stick chiefly to Yasmin’s perspective, her self-image slowly unravelling once she begins to grasp the nature of the shadow cast by her increasingly hard-drinking father, also a doctor. Private turmoil is amplified by ever-present workplace aggro, as Ali portrays a hard-pressed NHS prey to dodgy contractors and hidebound hierarchies, with a whistleblower subplot involving overmedicated geriatrics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/06/love-marriage-by-monica-ali-review-lurid-turns-and-lashings-of-sex"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The best books about islands, from Wide Sargasso Sea to Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/aug/23/the-best-books-about-islands-from-wide-sargasso-sea-to-dark-matter</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Author Kiran Millwood Hargrave picks her favourites, including Monique Roffey’s fabulist Caribbean and Madeline Miller’s witch banished by Zeus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Islands have obsessed authors for years. Something about observing society in miniature, surrounded by sea, is inescapably satisfying to write – and even more so to read. Again and again, I turn to books set on pieces of land marooned by water, in order to encounter communities at their most intense and intricate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Michael Crummey’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/04/galore-michael-crummey-review"&gt;Galore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, we meet the 19th-century inhabitants of a remote, small coastal town on Newfoundland, wrestling with all the best ingredients for a superstition-led saga spanning two centuries: a beached whale, a man birthed from its belly, and a wise woman determined to protect him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mercies by Kiran Millwood Hargrave is published by Picador (£8.99). To support the Guardian and Observer order your copy at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-mercies-9781529005134.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article"&gt;guardianbookshop.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Delivery charges may apply.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/aug/23/the-best-books-about-islands-from-wide-sargasso-sea-to-dark-matter"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Best fiction of 2021</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/04/best-fiction-of-2021</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dazzling debuts, a word-of-mouth hit, plus this year’s bestsellers from Sally Rooney, Jonathan Franzen, Kazuo Ishiguro and more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most anticipated, discussed and accessorised novel of the year was Sally Rooney’s &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/02/beautiful-world-where-are-you-by-sally-rooney-the" title=""&gt;Beautiful World, Where Are You&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Faber), launched on a tide of tote bags and bucket hats. It’s a book about the accommodations of adulthood, which plays with interiority and narrative distance as Rooney’s characters consider the purpose of friendship, sex and politics – plus the difficulties of fame and novel-writing – in a world on fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rooney’s wasn’t the only eagerly awaited new chapter. Polish Nobel laureate &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/olga-tokarczuk" title=""&gt;Olga Tokarczuk&lt;/a&gt;’s magnum opus &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/nov/10/the-books-of-jacob-by-olga-tokarczuk-review-a-messiahs-story" title=""&gt;The Books of Jacob&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Fitzcarraldo) reached English-language readers at last, in a mighty feat of translation by Jennifer Croft: a dazzling historical panorama about enlightenment both spiritual and scientific. In 2021 we also saw the returns of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/29/crossroads-by-jonathan-franzen-review-a-fine-start-to-a-family-trilogy" title=""&gt;Jonathan Franzen&lt;/a&gt;, beginning a fine and involving 70s family trilogy with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/29/crossroads-by-jonathan-franzen-review-a-fine-start-to-a-family-trilogy"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (4th Estate); Kazuo Ishiguro, whose &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/feb/25/klara-and-the-sun-by-kazuo-ishiguro-review-what-it-is-to-be-human" title=""&gt;Klara and the Sun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Faber) probes the limits of emotion in the story of a sickly girl and her “artificial friend”; and acclaimed US author Gayl Jones, whose epic of liberated slaves in 17th-century Brazil, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/sep/29/palmares-by-gayl-jones-review-a-long-awaited-vision-of-freedom" title=""&gt;Palmares&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Virago), has been decades in the making.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/04/best-fiction-of-2021"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The best children’s and YA books of 2021</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/06/the-best-childrens-and-ya-books-of-2021</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From magical picture books and rollicking adventures to the conclusion of Malorie Blackman’s Noughts and Crosses series, standout reads for all ages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After months of sadness and uncertainty, there is pure enchantment to be found in the year’s best children’s books. For picture-book lovers, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/scissorella-9781783448944" title=""&gt;Scissorella: The Paper Princess&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Clare Helen Welsh, illustrated by Laura Barrett (Andersen), is an extra-special story full of delicate filigree art. Mill worker Lotte, scorned by her siblings, cuts elegant puppets out of paper, trusting hard work over happy endings – until she’s invited to a ball, and meets a prince who loves puppets too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the luminous fairytale &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/frindleswylde-9781406388961" title=""&gt;Frindleswylde&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Natalia O’Hara, illustrated by Lauren O’Hara (Walker), a capricious winter spirit steals the light from Grandma’s lamp, and Cora must go to his icy kingdom to retrieve it – but will Frindleswylde freeze her heart first? Filled with pastel sweetness and frosty aquamarine light, this has a flavour of Hans Christian Andersen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/06/the-best-childrens-and-ya-books-of-2021"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The best science books of 2021</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/07/the-best-science-books-of-2021</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quarantine, the climate crisis, genetics and mysterious illnesses come under the microscope in this year’s highlights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early in the pandemic it was the blunt tools of past centuries that saved the most lives. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jul/11/vaxxers-by-sarah-gilbert-and-catherine-green-until-proven-safe-by-geoff-manaugh-and-nicola-twilley-reviews" title=""&gt;Until Proven Safe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, by Geoff Manaugh and Nicola Twilley (Picador), dives into the crudely effective and widely abused strategy of quarantine, the separation of those feared to be sick from those deemed healthy. The authors trace formal quarantine back to 14th-century Dubrovnik where, in response to the Black Death, visitors were ordered to spend a month in a nearby town or on an islet before entering the city. The strategy caught on elsewhere but, despite keeping disease at bay, discrimination, inconvenience and miserable conditions hardly encouraged compliance. In one spectacular failure, a plague-infested ship evaded Sicilian quarantine and left 16,000 dead on the island. Examples range from the Apollo astronauts (quarantined in case they carried lunar germs) and the Covid pandemic to efforts to prevent a “chocpocalypse” by protecting the cacao plant. With emerging diseases on the rise, quarantine is back for good, the authors warn, and it must be radically overhauled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the moment coronavirus took hold in China, the race was on to make a vaccine. That researchers designed, manufactured, trialled and received approval for jabs in a record 12 months is extraordinary. In &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jul/11/vaxxers-by-sarah-gilbert-and-catherine-green-until-proven-safe-by-geoff-manaugh-and-nicola-twilley-reviews" title=""&gt;Vaxxers &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jul/11/vaxxers-by-sarah-gilbert-and-catherine-green-until-proven-safe-by-geoff-manaugh-and-nicola-twilley-reviews" title=""&gt;(Hodder &amp;amp; Stoughton)&lt;/a&gt;, two key members of the Oxford Vaccine Group, Prof Sarah Gilbert and Dr Catherine Green, describe the gruelling effort behind that feat. The science is clear, as is the intense pressure the team was under, undoubtedly exacerbated by media scrutiny This is not the only Covid vaccine story: the tale of how mRNA shots came to be is arguably more compelling. But Oxford set out to make a “vaccine for the world” and put profit aside to achieve the goal. In an episode of history short on heroes, there is no need to look further.and controversies over the vaccine’s effectiveness, rare serious adverse events and how it would be distributed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/07/the-best-science-books-of-2021"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Uncontrollable Women by Nan Sloane review – history’s secret heroines</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/04/uncontrollable-women-by-nan-sloane-review-historys-secret-heroines</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A compelling study celebrates the working class pioneers of female emancipation who have been overlooked&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1822 Susannah Wright stood before the Lord Chief Justice accused of blasphemy. Despite her limited education, she was determined to conduct her own defence and duly began to read out a carefully prepared statement. Her “blasphemy” had nothing to do with being a potty mouth. Rather, Susannah was found guilty of selling a pamphlet that challenged the right of the Established Church to meddle in secular matters. Infuriated by the effrontery of this young lacemaker from Nottingham, the judge attempted to cut her off. Sharply, she told him to be quiet: “You, sir, are paid to hear me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a thrilling moment. It is also, suggests &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/14/women-political-history-quotations" title=""&gt;Nan Sloane&lt;/a&gt;, one that deserves to be far better known. The same goes for the many other occasions on which working-class women dared to speak truth to power during the first third of the 19th century, a time of bitter unrest when it looked as though Great Britain might follow France and America into revolution. There is, for instance, Mary Fildes, president of the Manchester Female Reform Society, who stood on the hustings alongside Henry Hunt at Peterloo in 1819 and only narrowly escaped death in the state-sanctioned carnage that followed. Or Jane Carlile who, like Susannah Wright, was found guilty of blasphemy for selling her husband’s newspaper The Republican, and was sentenced to two years inside Dorchester prison with her newborn baby.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/04/uncontrollable-women-by-nan-sloane-review-historys-secret-heroines"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>On Consolation by Michael Ignatieff review – timely meditations on comfort</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/03/on-consolation-by-michael-ignatieff-review-timely-meditations-on-comfort</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From Cicero to El Greco, Marx to Mahler, a study of solace through the ages offers lessons from the broken&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the world is in crisis, where should we look for comfort? Given humanity’s dwindling religious beliefs, we are less likely than previous generations to see our lives as part of a grand cosmic plan, or believe that paradise awaits in the great beyond. All of which can make consolation – the idea that there is a point to existence, and therefore to our tragedy and suffering – that much harder to find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his new book of essays, the Booker prize-shortlisted novelist, academic and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2008/dec/12/profile-michael-ignatieff" title=""&gt;erstwhile politician&lt;/a&gt; Michael Ignatieff examines the concept of solace over the centuries and how we might find it in our more secular age. “The challenge of consolation in our times,” he explains, “is to endure tragedy, even when we cannot hope to find a meaning for it, and to continue living in hope.” This is not a tract on how to improve your mental health or a guide to self-care. Rather, it’s a meditation on the nature of comfort, explored via a series of portraits of artists, writers and thinkers who have stood on the precipice of despair and sought consolation in difficult times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/03/on-consolation-by-michael-ignatieff-review-timely-meditations-on-comfort"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Betrayal of Anne Frank by Rosemary Sullivan review – who tipped off the Nazis?</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/02/the-betrayal-of-anne-frank-by-rosemary-sullivan-review-who-tipped-off-the-nazis</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite controversy surrounding its findings, the work of a ‘cold case team’ powerfully illuminates what it was like to live under a genocidal regime&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 4 August 1944 Gestapo officer Karl Josef Silberbauer, together with three Dutch policemen, marched into a spice merchant’s on Amsterdam’s Prinsengracht and demanded: “Where are the Jews?” It was a piercing moment in 20th-century history, one that never becomes dulled by retelling. Within minutes Silberbauer and his accomplices had located a dummy bookshelf, behind which lay a secret suite of rooms where two families had been hiding for two years. Placed under arrest, these eight men and women were subsequently sent to concentration camps in the east from which only one, the business’s owner, Otto Frank, returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know all this because one of Frank’s first postwar acts was to publish the journal that his 15-year-old daughter had kept during their immuration. The Diary of Anne Frank became a canonical text, one of the few accounts we have of living through Hitler’s Final Solution in real time. And it is Anne’s face – peaky, clever, ferociously alive – that has become the emblem of all the evil unleashed by antisemitism in Europe’s terrible mid-century. Yet despite the story being so familiar, there is one detail that remains a mystery. Who tipped off the authorities that there were people hiding at the back of Prinsengracht 263?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/02/the-betrayal-of-anne-frank-by-rosemary-sullivan-review-who-tipped-off-the-nazis"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Sexual Revolution by Laurie Penny review – playing fast and loose with the f-word</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/07/sexual-revolution-by-laurie-penny-review-playing-fast-and-loose-with-the-f-word</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Poorly researched and lacking serious analysis, this ‘searing critique of male dominance’ is almost comically relentless&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was a student, there was a craze among a small group of my friends for a bestselling self-help book called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/women-who-love-too-much-9780099474128"&gt;Women Who Love Too Much&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by an American therapist whose name was Robin Norwood. We were all feminists, though at this point (it was the late 80s) the f-word was painfully unfashionable, and on our shelves was lots of seriously good – if then already slightly retro – theoretical stuff: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/10/letter-val-mcdermid-on-kate-millett-obituary"&gt;Kate Millett&lt;/a&gt;, Janet Radcliffe Richards, Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, of course, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/apr/22/our-bodies-ourselves-clitoris-pain-pap-smears-womens-health"&gt;Our Bodies, Ourselves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; by the Boston Women’s Health Book Collective, in its millionth (or so) edition. But somewhat to our embarrassment, it was Norwood’s book whose spine was the most cracked. What can I say? At 19, and away from home for the first time, all we really wanted to know was how to stop wasting so much of our time and energy on horrible men.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/07/sexual-revolution-by-laurie-penny-review-playing-fast-and-loose-with-the-f-word"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>One Party After Another by Michael Crick review – the devilish luck of Nigel Farage</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/02/one-party-after-another-by-michael-crick-review-the-devilish-luck-of-nigel-farage</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Personal chaos and political recklessness characterise the most influential failure in modern British politics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like those of all political upstarts, Nigel Farage’s career is marked by generous helpings of luck. His story is full of tantalising what ifs, and in this definitive biography Michael Crick makes the most of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farage has survived three near-death experiences: twice in his early 20s, when he suffered a life-threatening car crash and then, months later, a misdiagnosed case of testicular cancer; and once in 2010, when on election day the plane in which he was flying for a publicity stunt got its banner caught in its tail fin and crashed in a field. Each time, Farage thought he would die; each time, somehow, he didn’t. He also benefited hugely from one death that did happen. In the 1997 general election James Goldsmith’s Referendum party outpolled the nascent Ukip by 8:1 and looked set to swallow its smaller, underfunded, chaotic rival. But then Goldsmith suddenly announced he was pulling back from politics and died of cancer 10 weeks after election day. Ukip picked up Referendum’s momentum and Farage never looked back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/02/one-party-after-another-by-michael-crick-review-the-devilish-luck-of-nigel-farage"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>What I Wish People Knew About Dementia by Wendy Mitchell review – a book of hope</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/01/what-i-wish-people-knew-about-dementia-by-wendy-mitchell-review-a-book-of-hope</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wendy Mitchell’s good-humoured practical guide to living with dementia has a deeper, more existential message for all of us: connect, forgive, accept and live&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One bright afternoon not long ago, Wendy Mitchell saw her father in her garden. She was inside with a mug of tea and he was standing on the lawn in his baggy green cardigan, smiling at her. She saw the yellow of his nicotine-stained fingers and the shine of his black, Brylcreemed hair. They stared at each other, happy to be together again. Then, in the blink of an eye, he was gone and the sunlit lawn was empty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her father had been dead for more than 20 years and the sighting of him through the glass door was simply one of the many visual hallucinations that ambush Mitchell: the escalator turns into a waterfall; a marble floor is a swimming pool; a patterned carpet writhes with creatures; a person dressed in black becomes a disembodied head floating on air. Seeing her dead father could have been scary, confusing or painfully distressing, but instead Mitchell accepted the trick that dementia was playing on her as a gift, a moment of grace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/01/what-i-wish-people-knew-about-dementia-by-wendy-mitchell-review-a-book-of-hope"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>America Over the Water by Shirley Collins review – a vivid tale of ballads, gunfire and rattlesnakes</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/31/america-over-the-water-by-shirley-collins-review-alan-lomax</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this welcome reissue of her 2004 memoir, the celebrated folk singer recounts her song-hunting 1959 journey through the American south with the folklorist Alan Lomax&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1959, transatlantic travel was still a niche privilege, not least for a young, single, working-class woman. Shirley Collins owed her ticket to New York on the SS United States to her romance with the American folklorist &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jul/23/guardianobituaries.johnfordham"&gt;Alan Lomax&lt;/a&gt;, whom she had met in London a couple of years previously. She was an ambitious 21-year-old folk singer from Sussex, he a celebrated song collector and musician 20 years her senior. Lomax had been in Europe for several years, effectively in exile from the anti-communist witch-hunt that had blacklisted musicians such as Pete Seeger, alongside Hollywood stars including Orson Welles and Charlie Chaplin. Even when collecting Spanish folk songs, Lomax had found himself shadowed by “the black crows” of Franco’s &lt;em&gt;guardia&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After returning to the US, Lomax invited Collins to join him on a song-hunting trip through the deep south, a journey memorably recounted in this memoir – reissued after 15 years out of print, albeit without the atmospheric photographs of the first edition. It offers a vivid and sometimes shocking portrait of a country yet to confront the civil rights era. The couple’s encounters ranged from pentecostal choirs (both black and white) and hellfire preachers to blind fiddlers and mountain ballad singers, some of them familiar to Lomax from a previous trip with his father. For Collins, this was a new world of epic landscapes, rattlesnakes, racism and nocturnal gunfire. St Leonards-on-Sea it wasn’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/31/america-over-the-water-by-shirley-collins-review-alan-lomax"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Violets by Alex Hyde review – a tender meditation on motherhood</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/04/violets-by-alex-hyde-review-a-tender-meditation-on-motherhood</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This lyrical debut novel examines the transformations of two women in the aftermath of the second world war&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pram Boy, pill-boy, you know who… it is you who will be carried / while the others are shed.” Violets begins with a miscarriage and a conception in the final months of the second world war. Violet Hall, a newly married suburban wife who is doing war work in a Birmingham munitions factory, loses blood and the foetuses of two babies into a pail and has her womb removed by callously zealous doctors. At the same time, in small-town Wales, unmarried Violet Owen conceives a child with her mother’s lodger, a Polish soldier. The book weaves between the two Violets, threaded throughout with insistently spirited, half-comical poetic interjections addressing Pram Boy, the baby who will bind these women’s lives together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first the two Violets are difficult to disentangle. Both are working class, both live in the shadows of more charismatic family members, both yearn vaguely for more expansive lives. Then we see Violet Owen make the most decisive step of her life. A few months pregnant, she signs on for war work and asks to be shipped abroad. Her time in Naples, vividly evoked with deft details rather than set-piece scenes, changes her but does not hold out the promise of a new life. This is partly because the letters she writes home to her family are flattened versions of her experiences that wilfully leave out the vivid sights she has seen: “No port, no cove, no filth, no decay. No light. No shade.” At the end of the war, she gives birth in a military hospital and is shipped back to England where, after eight months, she gives her baby up for adoption and Violet Hall’s turn for motherhood has come.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/04/violets-by-alex-hyde-review-a-tender-meditation-on-motherhood"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The best recent poetry – review roundup</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/04/the-best-recent-poetry-review-roundup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Then the War by Carl Phillips; Lurex by Denise Riley; Ephemeron by Fiona Benson; Why I No Longer Write Poems by Diana Anphimiadi; Hurricane Watch by Olive Senior&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then the War: And Selected Poems 2007-2020 by Carl Phillips (&lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/then-the-war-9781800172296?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article"&gt;Carcanet, £14.99&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Phillips’s new collection arrives carrying a Selected Poems on its shoulder. The 208 pages form a wonderfully compendious introduction to this major US poet. For those who have admired his work in the three decades since his debut, they are glowing confirmation that, as he enters his 60s, Phillips is writing better than ever. The poems that open Then the War are extraordinary ecological lyric verse, subtle and transformative. Invasive Species gives the plant switchgrass a voice: “Little song years remastering truth / now begins its own truth little song / deep in the night”; a poem about leaves is called Little Shields, in Starlight. This metamorphic fluidity allows us to understand our natural environment in a new way, and ensures these poems remain fully populated, by parents, lovers and friends. Phillips himself is in the frame in the reflexive sequence Among the Trees, a series of encounters with the natural world – and with love. The selection from earlier books that follows now reads as part of a single project of the utmost immediacy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/04/the-best-recent-poetry-review-roundup"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>A Previous Life by Edmund White review – salacious confessions</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/03/a-previous-life-by-edmund-white-review-salacious-confessions</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple share their sexual histories in this elegantly filthy report from the frontiers of desire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edmund White’s latest book – his 30th, by my count – bears the subtitle “Another posthumous novel”. This alludes not only to the fact that White has continued to write prolifically after suffering multiple strokes, but also to those critics who have dismissed his most recent novels as an old-school irrelevance to the brave new world of contemporary queer fiction. The acerbic preface to this new one suggests that we’re about to read an autobiographical account of an affair, written by a ravaged old queen who must surely be White himself. However, the opening pages of the book itself plunge us straight – no pun intended – into a turbulent, picaresque and obviously fictional narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The year is 2050; a married couple are holed up in a remote Swiss chalet while the husband recovers from a skiing accident. To while away this enforced convalescence, they decide to write a pair of complementary memoirs that will describe their previous sexual careers with absolute honesty. In order to make the game more exquisite, they will take it in turns to read these confessions out loud – meaning, of course, that we will be allowed to eavesdrop. We quickly discover that this is no ordinary marriage. The wife, Constance, is in her early 30s, while her husband, Ruggero, is at least four decades older; she is an African American orphan, while he is a legendarily well-connected (not to mention well-hung) Sicilian aristocrat who also happens to be a world-famous baroque harpsichordist. Oh, and the sometime lover of a deceased and forgotten gay novelist called Edmund White.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/03/a-previous-life-by-edmund-white-review-salacious-confessions"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Diego Rivera by Francisco de la Mora and José Luis Pescador review – rumbustious hymn to a radical artist</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/01/diego-rivera-by-francisco-de-la-mora-and-jose-luis-pescador-review-rumbustious-hymn-to-a-radical-artist</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The eventful life of Frida Kahlo’s revolutionary husband makes for a rich, energetic graphic biography&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this frenetic, rumbustious new graphic biography of Diego Rivera by Francisco de la Mora and José Luis Pescador, the Mexican artist’s third wife (and fourth: they married twice) appears only fleetingly. We don’t find out where or how they met; the powerful connection between them, never fully explained, must simply be taken for granted by the reader. But perhaps the authors feel that Frida Kahlo has had a bit too much attention just lately: who could forget the snaking queues at the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/10/frida-kahlo-making-her-self-up-v-and-a-cindy-sherman-spruth-magers-review"&gt;V&amp;amp;A’s show&lt;/a&gt; of her work in 2018? In their book, then, it’s Rivera who is centre stage. Like a raging bull, rushing into the ring for a fight, he dominates every page, all bristling melodrama and animal energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There have been two great accidents in my life,” Kahlo said. “Diego was by far the worst.” There is surely hyperbole in this statement, however unhappy Rivera made her at times (both of them were repeatedly unfaithful). But you grasp her meaning: the sense of collision that accompanied her husband wherever he went. Though his talent was prodigious – he went to art school at 11 – it often struggled to find its place in a life that was by any standards overpopulated with incident. Born in 1886, Rivera was the son of a journalist who was involved in revolutionary politics, instincts he would famously go on to share. Travelling in Europe, he met Lenin in Paris and Stalin in Moscow; later, he offered refuge to Trotsky during his Mexican exile. But revolutionaries come in many guises. If he talked the talk – even after fame arrived, he remained proudly un-clubbable – he was also easily distracted, usually (though not exclusively) by women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/01/diego-rivera-by-francisco-de-la-mora-and-jose-luis-pescador-review-rumbustious-hymn-to-a-radical-artist"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>My Father’s Diet by Adrian Nathan West review – sadness on steroids</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/03/my-fathers-diet-by-adrian-nathan-west-review-sadness-on-steroids</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This slim comic debut about an estranged family and a bodybuilding father is a striking study of failure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oh, nice!” says a father to his son when he learns a package has arrived for him. The son asks what it is. “Well, ha, ha, you’re probably going to think your old man’s lost his damned mind. It’s called Finaplix. Trenbolone acetate. It’s a cattle steroid. They give it to heifers to beef them up before slaughter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The father doesn’t have an appointment at an abattoir but with a photographer, who will capture him smothered in baby oil “half-snarling and half-beaming” in black bikini briefs as he poses for the final stage of the Body You Choose competition. At the age of 55, he has become a bodybuilder. If the son thinks he has lost his mind, he keeps it to himself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/03/my-fathers-diet-by-adrian-nathan-west-review-sadness-on-steroids"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Free Love by Tessa Hadley review – an affair to remember</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/30/free-love-by-tessa-hadley-review-an-affair-to-remember</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A married woman’s fling with a young 1960s rabble-rouser is the centrepiece of this elegant, shrewd and complex novel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The energy in a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/09/tessa-hadley-interview"&gt;Tessa Hadley&lt;/a&gt; novel typically flows from a character’s unvoiced longing or suppressed desire, gestured at in flashback over the course of a present-day narrative seamlessly encompassing the previous half-century, as in 2015’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/28/the-past-by-tessa-hadley-review"&gt;The Past&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; or 2019’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/11/late-in-the-day-tessa-hadley-review"&gt;Late in the Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, titles that sum up the mood, if not the excitement, of her work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At first glance, &lt;em&gt;Free Love&lt;/em&gt; breaks with all that. It takes us from 1967 into 1968 in the company of a flighty middle-aged mother of two, Phyllis, who quits married life in the stockbroker belt with a Foreign Office high-up after falling for a mouthy young dinner guest, Nicky, the would-be revolutionary son of family friends working in oil. An after-dinner search for a child’s missing sandal supplies the pretext for a clinch in the dusk; soon, Phyllis is knocking on the door of Nicky’s rundown flat in eye-openingly multicultural west London every Wednesday, under cover of visiting her father in Leamington Spa.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there’s folly here, it’s part of the novel’s trick to tempt us to see it as belonging only to Phyllis, when the tangled roots of the situation truly lie elsewhere. As Hadley shifts fluently between the points of view of the various parties involved, the novel turns as much on long-buried family secrets as it does the yearnings of itchy-footed middle age. Each member of Phyllis’s household, including her children, Colette, 16, and Hugh, nine, know something the others don’t; we’re in the dark, too, thanks to a twist that rests on Hadley not quite playing fair when, halfway through, the novel first accesses the thoughts of her husband, Roger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hadley’s complex sentences are purring marvels of engineering, always weighted just so, cut-glass English with a continental inflection, fond of a comma splice, the dialogue marked with a dash. A brilliant writer of interiority who can also do great scenes, she has a gift, especially, for portraying the state of wanting to be wanted, or simply to be seen – a recurring longing in her fiction, whose characters often have cause to be careful what they wish for. We see Phyllis, aching and raw, privately exulting while getting the dinner on back at home; we see the electric thrill of a touch of hands between long-separated lovers; or Colette, drunk, wanting to go “all the way” with a man, “her consciousness swooping over her like a hawk”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If she shares a theme with Martin Amis and Michel Houellebecq – the pros and cons of the sexual revolution – her method couldn’t be more different: not comic grotesque or authorial hypothesis, but patiently inhabiting her characters, leaving it to us to gauge how their actions are shaped by the weight of experience, a technique that can’t help but elicit readerly sympathy. Yes, Nicky’s political grandstanding puts us in mind of &lt;em&gt;Citizen Smith&lt;/em&gt; – when Phyllis extols the virtues of the NHS, he replies: “Keeps the factory workers healthy, so they can work for longer” – but Phyllis’s awakening at his hands isn’t mocked, exactly; Hadley’s too subtle, too generous for that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/30/free-love-by-tessa-hadley-review-an-affair-to-remember"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Winchelsea by Alex Preston review – a ripping yarn of Sussex smuggling</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/30/winchelsea-by-alex-preston-review-a-ripping-yarn-of-sussex-smuggling</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Espionage, witchcraft, gore and spellbinding language propel an exciting historical adventure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex Preston’s fourth novel sprang from the notion of crafting a “grown-up” &lt;em&gt;Moonfleet&lt;/em&gt;, he explains in his acknowledgments, adding “I hope this is close”. For anyone who’s familiar with J Meade Falkner’s swashbuckling 1898 tale of smuggling and shipwreck, the answer is a boisterous yes, but readers for whom that evocative title draws a blank need know only this: you’re in for a treat. Its short, salty chapters are crammed with murder, treason and illicit embraces, with chases, battles and perilous high-seas skulduggery. There is international espionage, a whisper of witchcraft, and a cast of orphans, rogues and redcoats. There are, should you still need persuading, &lt;em&gt;maps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Winchelsea&lt;/em&gt; takes its title from its East Sussex setting, a crumbling town whose heyday is long passed. It opens there in 1742, when heroine Goody is barely 16 years old. Saved from drowning as a babe, she is the adopted daughter of a French herbalist and one Ezekiel Brown, a local who straddles two worlds, being both physician and – like all Browns before him – “cellarman”, allowing smugglers known as the Mayfield gang to stow their spoils in the maze of tunnels that run from his home, Paradise, down beneath the streets and out to the seashore.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/30/winchelsea-by-alex-preston-review-a-ripping-yarn-of-sussex-smuggling"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A monster trying to order pizza, a Nigerian girls’ boarding-school story, a YA Indian fantasy about scheming siblings – and much more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/baby-sleepy-baby-9781406389579?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article"&gt;Baby, Sleepy Baby&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atinuke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angela Brooksbank&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; (Walker, £12.99)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This dreamy, unrhymed lullaby for the tiniest listeners is based on a song from the author’s own childhood. Illustrated in soft moonlit tones, it’s filled with smiles, stars and a sense of boundless love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article"&gt;Monster!

A shouty, colourful picture-book romp, begging to be read aloud with gusto.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/28/childrens-and-teens-roundup-the-best-new-picture-books-and-novels"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Young adult books round-up – review</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/11/young-adult-books-round-up-review</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fantasy worlds, feminism and school squabbles are all on the agenda this month&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For long winter nights, Joanna Ruth Meyer’s lush, folkloric debut &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/echo-north-9781782693550"&gt;Echo North&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Pushkin, £8.99) is certain to enchant. In a Russian-inspired fantasy world, Echo makes a pact with a strange talking wolf: she will live for a year in his house and in exchange the wolf will save her father’s life. There, she finds secrets, danger, a magical library and the mystery of the wolf’s enchantment to unravel. Immersive and romantic, it’s a unique spin on fairytales such as &lt;em&gt;East of the Sun and West of the Moon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are more fairytales in Natasha Bowen’s epic debut &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/skin-of-the-sea-9780241413975"&gt;Skin of the Sea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (Penguin, £7.99), which fuses &lt;em&gt;The Little Mermaid&lt;/em&gt; with west African mythology. Simi, a young black mermaid, is one of the Mami Wata, duty-bound to gather the souls of those who die at sea. When a living boy is thrown from a slave ship, Simi defies the decree to save his life and must travel to the supreme creator to make her amends. Fantastical creatures and vengeful gods form a vivid backdrop to this rich and original story of one girl’s journey to find herself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/11/young-adult-books-round-up-review"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Tony Lyons, the US publisher who picks up books ‘cancelled’ by other presses</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/27/tony-lyons-skyhorse-publisher-cancelled-books</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The man behind Skyhorse books, which has published recent works by Woody Allen, Blake Bailey and Norman Mailer, explains why he keeps taking on controversial books&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people won’t have heard of Tony Lyons. Indeed, the US publisher has built an independent press – Skyhorse Publishing – that to some degree delights in defying the mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skyhorse’s basic business model is to pick up backlisted books and profitably reissue them. Back to Basics, a book that “will help you dye your own wool with plant pigments, graft trees, raise chickens, craft a hutch table with hand tools, and make treats such as blueberry peach jam and cheddar cheese”, is one that perennially helps to keeps the company’s lights on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/27/tony-lyons-skyhorse-publisher-cancelled-books"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Rebecca Watson: ‘This novel was never an act of catharsis’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/22/rebecca-watson-this-novel-was-never-an-act-of-catharsis</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Goldsmiths prize-shortlisted author of little scratch on being mistaken for the book’s protagonist, conveying the ‘immediate present-tense experience’, and why her next novel is even more ambitious&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;R&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jan/31/introducing-our-10-best-debut-novelists-of-2021"&gt;ebecca Watson&lt;/a&gt;’s first novel, &lt;em&gt;little scratch&lt;/em&gt;, now published in paperback, is narrated over the course of a single day by an unnamed office junior living in the wake of a sexual assault. The &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; called it an “extraordinary debut [that] conveys the shapes and the rhythms of thought” by “arranging text in unconventional ways”. Shortlisted for last year’s Goldsmiths prize, it was recently staged in a production &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/nov/12/little-scratch-review-rebecca-watson-katie-mitchell"&gt;directed by Katie Mitchell&lt;/a&gt;. Watson, 26, grew up in the South Downs and spoke to me from London, where she works part-time as an assistant editor on the arts desk of the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What led you to the book’s unusual form?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;It came from a very clear moment. A colleague walked past me and asked what I’d been reading recently. And for 10 seconds I couldn’t come up with an answer, then I did, and he left. I was just really struck by that encounter, which was nothing, but for a moment had stakes that were kind of far too high. It made me very aware of the layers and channels of present tense. I remember saying to myself, how would you write it? And I just instantly wrote that moment on a [notebook] page to show the way in which things [and thoughts] happen simultaneously. It was only a few hundred words, but in it was the answer to how to present immediate present-tense experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did it look like written down?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;It was very much that as you went down the page you passed through time, and that the page also really seemed like the mind: the left- and right-hand side had different feelings to them and there were different kinds of tonal spaces across the page. It flipped a switch: I had the insinuation of the book’s formal system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/22/rebecca-watson-this-novel-was-never-an-act-of-catharsis"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘The clap for the NHS meant nothing’: novelist turned doctor Roopa Farooki on her frontline experience of Covid</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/22/the-clap-for-the-nhs-meant-nothing-novelist-turned-doctor-roopa-farooki-on-her-frontline-experience-of-covid</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When the writer retrained in medicine, she never imagined she’d be working through a pandemic. She describes how she has coped with the everyday tragedy by putting her experience into words&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 2020, when the novelist and doctor Roopa Farooki first sat down to write her latest book, coronavirus was “something that was kind of buzzing around” in the background. “Those of us going to work every day in a hospital, we weren’t really aware of it; we were just blindly doing our job, day by day, patient by patient. Knowing there was this thing happening, but it was insidious. There was a clue here or there, but we weren’t absolutely sure how far it would affect us, or how far it would change us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farooki’s sister Kiron had just died of breast cancer. Kiron was 48, a solicitor and a mother. She had previously been unwell, but the cancer had gone into remission. “We thought she had beaten this thing,” says Farooki. Her sister was straight-talking, fierce in her love, prone to doling out advice whether Farooki wanted to hear it or not. “She was super-amazing at everything she did.” To process it all, Farooki did what she has done since she was a little girl: she wrote about it. “Before she passed away, she saw that I was thinking about her and writing about it. She wasn’t angry about it. But you always worry when you write about someone that you’re twisting yourself into someone else’s tragedy.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/22/the-clap-for-the-nhs-meant-nothing-novelist-turned-doctor-roopa-farooki-on-her-frontline-experience-of-covid"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘I yelled with joy’: how Caleb Azumah Nelson went from Apple store employee to Costa First Novel award winner</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/21/i-yelled-with-joy-how-caleb-azumah-nelson-went-from-apple-store-employee-to-costa-first-novel-award-winner</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The London writer on the success of his first book, Open Water, the limitations of masculinity and why his writing shouldn’t be compared to Sally Rooney’s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day, during the first Covid lockdown, Caleb Azumah Nelson’s father offered to cut his hair. “He’s not great with his words, but that’s a very specific way of saying: ‘Can I care for you?’” explains the 28-year-old writer and photographer, who spent the pandemic back in his family home in south-east London with his parents and his younger twin siblings. It’s just such moments that illuminate his debut novel, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/feb/19/open-water-by-caleb-azumah-nelson-review-an-exciting-ambitious-debut" title=""&gt;Open Water&lt;/a&gt;: tender, carefully observed and reported, casting a gentle light on the limitations of masculinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot has happened since the book was published: he’s toured Germany, Austria and Switzerland; won the American accolade of a listing among the National Book Foundation’s “5 under 35” for exciting young writers; and this month he scooped his first big prize, the Costa first novel award, which brings with it the chance of being chosen as the overall book of the year, next month. He was standing in the street when the news came through: “I yelled with joy. It absolutely hadn’t been on my radar. I’ve been too busy trying to write the next one.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/21/i-yelled-with-joy-how-caleb-azumah-nelson-went-from-apple-store-employee-to-costa-first-novel-award-winner"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘They are literally murdering us’: poet Joelle Taylor on bringing the LGBTQ+ community together</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/17/poet-joelle-taylor-ts-eliot-prize-lgbtq-community</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;She’s been marginalised and slapped in the street – but Taylor’s passionate and nostalgic poems about butch lesbian subculture just won the TS Eliot prize. Can they also heal the divisions over gender identity? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/10/joelle-taylor-wins-ts-eliot-poetry-prize-for-blazing-cnto-othered-poems"&gt;winning the TS Eliot award for poetry last week&lt;/a&gt;, Joelle Taylor has been referred to on more than one occasion as a “slam poet”. Which, she says, is fascinating: “Because there’s no such thing as a slam poet.” A poetry slam is an event, a spoken-word competition, she adds, not a type of poetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor, who was named UK performance poetry slam champion in 2000 and founded the national youth slam championships &lt;a href="https://slam.poetrysociety.org.uk/"&gt;SLAMbassadors&lt;/a&gt;, is forgiving, though: “It’s just a way of people trying to understand a different kind of poetry.” But it’s clear that this need to distinguish spoken word from other forms of poetry has a whiff of snobbery about it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/17/poet-joelle-taylor-ts-eliot-prize-lgbtq-community"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘I read the book out to the girls. It was really tough’: Andrea Elliott on writing about New York’s homeless children</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/16/andrea-elliott-interview-invisible-child-dasani-coates</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pulitzer-winning New York Times journalist talks about her new book, Invisible Child, which records the experiences of a young girl growing up homeless in Brooklyn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/16/invisible-child-extract-andrea-elliott-dasani-coates"&gt;Read an extract from Invisible Child here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrea Elliott is a Pulitzer prize-winning journalist &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/andrea-elliott"&gt;at the&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/andrea-elliott"&gt; New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Through December 2013 she published a five-part series in the paper exploring the homelessness epidemic in New York City. It told the story of Dasani Coates, an 11-year-old girl living with her family in a run-down homeless shelter in Brooklyn. Elliott continued to follow the family over the course of almost a decade, recording their experiences in her first book, &lt;em&gt;Invisible Child: Poverty, Survival and Hope in New York City&lt;/em&gt;, published last year. Elliott’s maternal family fled Chile during the Pinochet era. She lives in New York with her two children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you choose Dasani?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;What mattered most to me was finding a child who wanted to be heard and who could narrate her experience of growing up poor to me. I think it’s incredibly important, it’s essential, to give a voice to the person whose story I’m telling. It’s important to have a communicator, because I think the best writing and reporting rests on the power of intimacy. She was a kid it was almost impossible to keep quiet. She had so much to say and I wanted to hear every word of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invisible Child: Poverty, Survival and Hope in New York City &lt;/em&gt;by Andrea Elliott is published by Hutchinson Heinemann on 27 January (£16.99).

      <title>David Mitchell: ‘If I need cheering up, Jamie Oliver’s recipes usually help’</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The novelist on mind-expanding Ursula K Le Guin, reading Joyce’s Ulysses during lockdown and taking comfort in cookbooks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My earliest reading memory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aged five or so, at primary school: a story about two siblings, Janet and John, who didn’t have much of a life beyond throwing a red ball. Soon after, Roger Hargreaves’s Mr Greedy – much more fun, and terrifying when the giant shows up. The cover retained my bite marks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My favourite book growing up &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/dec/12/comfort-reading-penelope-lively-ghost-thomas-kempe" title=""&gt;The Ghost of Thomas Kempe&lt;/a&gt; by Penelope Lively, about a boy chosen by an alchemist’s spirit to be an apprentice. It’s beautifully written, is set in English rural world of my boyhood, and I found reassurance in how the story was resolved not by force or cunning, but by acceptance, time and what we’d now call emotional intelligence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/04/david-mitchell-if-i-need-cheering-up-jamie-olivers-recipes-usually-help"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
