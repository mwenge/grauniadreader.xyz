      <title>‘I have no more tears’: Beijing’s Winter Olympics hit by athlete complaints</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/i-have-no-more-tears-beijing-winter-olympics-hit-by-athlete-complaints</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swedish team suggest schedule needs altering due to cold&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Isolation issues continue; Germany bemoan lack of hot food&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the eve of the Winter Olympics, China promised the world a “streamlined, safe and most splendid” Games. But just two days into the event organisers are facing a litany of complaints from athletes and countries on multiple fronts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swedes have suggested that the conditions in the mountains are perilously cold. A Polish skater says she was living in fear in a Beijing isolation ward and has “cried until I have no more tears”. The Finns have claimed an ice hockey player is being kept in Covid quarantine for no reason. And the Germans? They are frustrated that there is no hot food at the downhill skiing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/i-have-no-more-tears-beijing-winter-olympics-hit-by-athlete-complaints"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Nottingham Forest 4-1 Leicester City: FA Cup fourth round – as it happened</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/feb/06/nottingham-forest-v-leicester-city-fa-cup-fourth-round-live</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Leicester, the defending champions mind you, were thrashed by a young, vibrant and rather exciting Nottingham Forest side at the City Ground&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 mins: &lt;/strong&gt;A lovely cross from Johnson on the Forest right is headed to the edge of the area, where Yates is brought down. Free kick, and a decent shooting chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 mins: &lt;/strong&gt;A predictably full-throttle opening to the game, but no chances yet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/feb/06/nottingham-forest-v-leicester-city-fa-cup-fourth-round-live"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Smith exit shows split personality of Eddie Jones’s England regime remains | Robert Kitson</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/smith-exit-shows-split-personality-of-eddie-joness-england-regime-remains</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scotland trusted their playmaker Finn Russell, who delivered the late win, but Jones was too hasty in removing his fly-half&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just one weekend in and the Six Nations is already stirring powerful emotions. In Scotland, with the Calcutta Cup under lock and key once again, there is renewed optimism and pride after the significant outcome on Saturday. And in England? To say Eddie Jones and his squad headed homewards with much to ponder is a familiar understatement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even given the tricky conditions at Murrayfield, the visitors’ 20-17 defeat will be a source of acute and prolonged frustration. Apart from anything else, a couple of uneasy trends are emerging. For the third successive year any faint grand slam hopes have vanished within 80 minutes and, for the fourth time in five seasons, Jones has been unable to outflank Scotland’s head coach Gregor Townsend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/smith-exit-shows-split-personality-of-eddie-joness-england-regime-remains"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Gabin Villière hat-trick fires France to opening victory against Italy</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/france-italy-six-nations-match-report</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;France 37-10 Italy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Italy put up brave fight but class of French tells&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supposedly this was a question of how many tries France would score; how quickly they would emulate the bonus-point victory achieved so ruthlessly by Ireland against Wales on Saturday. As it turned out, a brave and coherent display by Italy and a sodden afternoon in Paris combined to make it more difficult than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all the recent talk of a ‘New England’ in the Six Nations, and despite their 27-point defeat, perhaps it is Kieran Crowley’s Italy that are starting afresh. They were ultimately overwhelmed by Gabin Villière’s hat-trick but can be proud of the way they defended. It was more than simple passion and commitment: there was a plan and a structure. A muscular early run by Juan Ignacio Brex hinted at a testing time ahead for France.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/france-italy-six-nations-match-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Buoyant Scotland looking to build on Calcutta Cup victory&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Townsend: ‘We know the atmosphere will be immense’&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If talk in Edinburgh’s overflowing bars on Saturday evening was turning to thoughts of a long-overdue Six Nations title tilt, those tasked with guiding the next stage of Scotland’s journey were understandably keen to sound a note of caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is only 12 months since the Scots enjoyed a similarly giddy &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/feb/06/england-scotland-six-nations-rugby-union-match-report" title=""&gt;opening-day triumph against England&lt;/a&gt; at Twickenham – a far more comprehensive win than the 11-6 scoreline suggested.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/scotland-coach-gregor-townsend-warns-team-to-beware-wounded-wales"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Ireland forge Six Nations title path with Wales dispatched and France waiting</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/ireland-forge-six-nations-title-path-with-wales-dispatched-and-france-waiting</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Defending champions beaten 29-7 in opening game&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ireland have now won nine matches in a row&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whichever angle viewed from, this Ireland team are starting to look very impressive. And, boy, do they do angles. The sheer number by which Irish runners came at Wales had the latter’s defence more than a little stressed throughout. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/05/ireland-wales-six-nations-rugby-union-match-report" title=""&gt;Four tries ensued in a comfortable-sounding 29-7 win&lt;/a&gt;, but really the cold stats hardly do justice to the nature of this dismantling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is nine wins in a row now for Ireland since they underwhelmed in their opening two fixtures of the championship this time a year ago. When the world rankings are refreshed on Monday, they will leapfrog England into third to become the highest placed of the Six Nations. But they remain second favourites to France (world No 5), who will host them in Paris on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/ireland-forge-six-nations-title-path-with-wales-dispatched-and-france-waiting"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Barcelona roll back the years in thrilling win over Atlético Madrid</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/barcelona-roll-back-the-years-in-thrilling-win-over-atletico-madrid</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just like old times; well, a little bit, at least. Adama Traoré is back, Xavi Hernández is back, and Dani Alves is back. Even Luis Suárez was back in front of the Camp Nou fans and scoring, another familiar face to go with the new ones here. It would be a stretch to suggest that FC Barcelona are back – it would be absurd, in fact – but this victory was their first against Atlético Madrid in five meetings, lifting them over Diego Simeone’s side and into a Champions League place they have not looked like occupying all season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as importantly, it was as much fun as they have had for a long time. Traoré, the kid who played his last and until now only league game for the club in the 2013-14 season, returned for his second debut and for a while ripped into Atlético, providing an assist as Barcelona came from behind to win 4-2. Alves, who last scored here in 2015, assisted, scored, leapt into Xavi’s arms, and was sent off. And even Jordi Alba got on the scoresheet on an afternoon where fans might have wondered what year it is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/barcelona-roll-back-the-years-in-thrilling-win-over-atletico-madrid"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Klopp hails ‘proper fairytale’ of Harvey Elliott’s comeback goal for Liverpool</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teenager scored against Cardiff in first game since horror injury&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Klopp: ‘When we lost him it was one of my hardest moments’&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jürgen Klopp savoured the “proper fairytale” of Harvey Elliott’s Liverpool comeback as the teenager scored his first goal for the club, 21 weeks after suffering a dislocated ankle, in a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/liverpool-cardiff-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report"&gt;3-1 win against Cardiff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elliott was taken off on a stretcher in Liverpool’s September win at Leeds, prompting fears for his future in an injury of such apparent severity that Klopp declared it was one of his worst moments in the game. But the winger scored a high-class goal, 18 minutes into his return, while the debutant Luis Díaz began his Liverpool career with an assist for Takumi Minamino’s strike.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/klopp-hails-proper-fairytale-of-harvey-elliotts-comeback-goal-for-liverpool"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Honeysuckle gives Irish crowds taste of what to expect at Cheltenham</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/honeysuckle-proves-a-class-apart-in-irish-champion-hurdle-triumph</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mare wins by six lengths and odds-on for Festival repeat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chacun Pour Soi and Galopin Des Champs both impress too&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no travelling fans at Cheltenham last March to see Ireland win all but five of the 28 races but there was a sense here on Sunday of the atmosphere that surely awaits next month, as a string of Ireland’s major contenders prepared for the Festival with effortless victories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honeysuckle, whose climb to the top of the hurdling division has largely unfolded in front of empty stands, even got a cheer as she cantered to post for the Irish Champion Hurdle, and while few in the crowd would have seen much point in backing her at 1-5, the reception for Rachael Blackmore’s mount after an easy six-and-a-half length success was long and loud. On this form, there is little chance that Honeysuckle will surrender what is now a 14-race unbeaten record in the Champion Hurdle on 15 March, and every sign that she could still be getting better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/honeysuckle-proves-a-class-apart-in-irish-champion-hurdle-triumph"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Scotland can build momentum from famous victory over auld enemy | Bryn Palmer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Gregor Townsend’s side continued their knack of winning close encounters in the Six Nations opener against England&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a sign of a team’s progress is their ability to win close matches, Scotland are heading firmly in the right direction. This was hardly a conclusive statement of their Six Nations title credentials but it was not a bad start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a second successive victory over England for the first time since 1984 – they went on to win their second grand slam that year – and a third in five meetings with England.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/06/scotland-can-build-momentum-from-famous-victory-over-auld-enemy"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

Off it, they discovered they had secured a place in the semi-finals on Monday despite this defeat. Funny old game, curling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds were in the changing rooms when news of their qualification filtered through. Their first reaction was to give each other a hug. The second was to remind themselves that their job is only half done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/britains-mixed-curlers-secure-semi-final-spot-despite-defeat-by-norway"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Andy Murray to miss French Open and sit out entire clay-court season</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/andy-murray-to-miss-french-open-and-sit-out-entire-clay-court-season</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Murray not ruling out clay return in future, but not this year&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Briton working with Dani Vallverdu in Rotterdam this week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy Murray will skip the French Open and the whole of the clay-court season as he plots his course through the rest of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in action in Rotterdam next week for the first time since &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/20/andy-murray-australian-taro-daniel-defeat"&gt;his second-round exit&lt;/a&gt; at the Australian Open, the Briton is taking a bigger-picture view of the year ahead. Looking for a new coach after a trial period with Jan De Witt ended after Melbourne, Murray is in the Netherlands and again working with Dani Vallverdu. He is available while Stan Wawrinka recovers his fitness but, whoever becomes Murray’s next permanent coach, Roland Garros will not be forming part of their schedule.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/andy-murray-to-miss-french-open-and-sit-out-entire-clay-court-season"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Triumph comes in women’s moguls on day two in Beijing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Historic day for Australia after earlier bronze for Tess Coady&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jakara Anthony has ended a 12-year Winter Olympics gold-medal drought for Australia by claiming a dominant victory in the women’s moguls at the Beijing Games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 23-year-old Anthony scored 83.09 points in the six-woman super final. American Jaelin Kauf (80.28) was second and Anastasiia Smirnova (77.72) of the Russian Olympic Committee was third.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/jakara-anthony-ends-australia-12-year-gold-drought-at-winter-olympics-beijing"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;20-year-old makes Olympic history in women’s slopestyle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Julia Marino and Tess Coady win silver and bronze, respectively&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoi Sadowski-Synnott made history by winning New Zealand’s first gold medal at a Winter Olympic Games, capturing the women’s slopestyle title on Sunday morning in smash-and-grab fashion with a dramatic final run that ended the US’s dominance in the discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 20-year-old, who became Olympic champion &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/06/like-a-forest-without-birdsong-waitangi-day-becomes-more-reflective-as-covid-takes-toll" title=""&gt;on Waitangi Day&lt;/a&gt; New Zealand’s national day, put down the run of her life in the biggest competition of her career to overtake the American Julia Marino, who had set the benchmark with her second of three attempts that nearly held up before she had to settle for silver in the mountain village of Taizicheng roughly 120km northwest of Beijing. Tess Coady took the bronze to win Australia’s first medal of these Games with a clutch final run of her own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/05/zoi-sadowski-synnott-new-zealand-first-winter-olympic-gold-snowboard-beijing-2022-tess-coady"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Australia’s curlers get Winter Olympics reprieve despite Covid positive</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/australias-curlers-to-leave-winter-olympics-after-positive-covid-19-test</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tahli Gill tests positive before final two matches in Beijing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gill and Dean Hewitt to resume maiden Olympics campaign&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia’s mixed doubles curlers have finally won their first game at the Winter Olympics – just a “crazy” few hours being told they had to leave China due to a positive Covid test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the team’s bags packed after Tahli Gill returned a series of positive Covid-19 tests, she and her partner Dean Hewitt were given a dramatic reprieve. They then had just 15 minutes to race to the venue, with Gill bringing only one glove in the mayhem, but they somehow went on to beat Switzerland 9-6. It was their first victory after seven successive defeats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/australias-curlers-to-leave-winter-olympics-after-positive-covid-19-test"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Australia win Women’s Ashes series after miserable England batting display</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/australia-win-womens-ashes-series-after-miserable-england-batting-display</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;England 129; Australia 131-5 – Australia win by five wickets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hosts take 10-4 lead in the series with one ODI remaining&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia strolled to victory in the second one-day international of the women’s Ashes, winning the overall series with a game to spare having retained the trophy in the previous outing. Until this point England had provided a good contest, but at Melbourne’s Junction Oval they were rolled for a paltry 129 after being sent in to bat and bowled out in 42.5 overs. Australia chased the score five wickets down in with nearly 15 overs to spare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was Australia’s first Ashes win at home in the multi-format style that combines 50-over, 20-over and Test cricket. Charlotte Edwards led England to a win in 2013-14, and Heather Knight’s 2017 team tied: the Australians went large on celebrations after retaining the trophy, only for England to win the final two matches. The same scenario was possible this time, England trailing 4-8 on points with two games to play, but none of the Australian players or staff from last time had forgotten that frustration. History never looked a chance to repeat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/06/australia-win-womens-ashes-series-after-miserable-england-batting-display"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Marcus Smith hints at electric future as inexperience costs England dear | Andy Bull</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/05/marcus-smith-hints-at-electric-future-as-inexperience-costs-england-dear-scotland-six-nations</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the Six Nations loss to Scotland, Eddie Jones’s side have the makings of a great team if they can learn key lessons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last time England made the trip to this stadium was back in February 2020, their last away game before the world turned upside down. That was a tight, miserly game on a miserable wet, grey and windy day, and there were long stretches here when it felt as if they had picked the contest up right where they’d left it before the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest difference was in the England team. Only five of this starting XV had been in that one: Elliot Daly, Tom Curry, Lewis Ludlam, Maro Itoje and Kyle Sinckler. One of them, Daly, was playing in a different position while another, Ludlam, was making his first start since that previous encounter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/05/marcus-smith-hints-at-electric-future-as-inexperience-costs-england-dear-scotland-six-nations"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Mack Hansen makes impact as Ireland aim for Total Farrell | Jonathan Liew</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/05/mack-hansen-makes-instant-impact-as-ireland-aim-for-total-farrell</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Defending Six Nations champions Wales had no answers on young Connacht wing’s explosive senior international debut&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can tell there’s a World Cup on next year: Ireland are hitting their peak. Still, this was an ominous statement of intent by Andy Farrell’s side at a blustery and bellicose Aviva Stadium: standards set, gauntlets thrown down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trip to Paris already feels like the potential crux of this tournament, which feels like a faintly ridiculous statement to make after 80 minutes of play. But for Ireland and their long-agonising supporters, it may just be time to start believing the hype. It was a measure of Ireland’s dominance that a normally edgy crowd had begun to relax well before the end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/05/mack-hansen-makes-instant-impact-as-ireland-aim-for-total-farrell"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Querulous Queiroz and his histrionic Egypt have the smarts to outwit Senegal | Jonathan Wilson</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Billing Sunday’s Africa Cup of Nations final as a clash of Salah and Mané misses the wider point in a shambolic tournament&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mohamed Salah against Sadio Mané, two great Liverpool forwards going head-to-head in Sunday’s Africa Cup of Nations final. It’s the headline clash of Egypt against Senegal, the meeting of the most successful side in African history and a team that has never lifted the trophy. But to focus on them would be misleading: although both have had an influence late in games, neither Senegal nor Egypt could be said to be teams based around their attacking talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is an unavoidable sense that even to focus on the football is itself uncomfortable, given the tragic events of a fortnight ago when eight fans were trampled to death outside Stade Olembé, where the final will be staged. The quarter-final at the venue was moved, but after a review it was decided Thursday’s semi-final should be played there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/05/querulous-queiroz-and-his-histrionic-egypt-have-the-smarts-to-outwit-senegal"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Kaitlyn Weaver: ‘There was so much more to me than I was able to show’</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Canadian Olympic ice dancer found herself limited by the expectations of what a woman should be in her sport. Coming out helped liberate her&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several months after coming out publicly as a queer woman, Canadian ice dance star Kaitlyn Weaver was doing a show in Nashville when another woman approached her and asked, “Are you and Andrew dating?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman was referring to Andrew Poje, Weaver’s ice dance partner of 15 years. Weaver told her no, and the conversation flowed into a different topic, before the woman interrupted Weaver to ask her the same question.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/05/kaitlyn-weaver-there-was-so-much-more-to-me-than-i-was-able-to-show"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Chelsea close gap at top of WSL after Guro Reiten sees off Manchester City</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/chelsea-manchester-city-womens-super-league-match-report</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Emma Hayes praised the “champion-like performance” in the stifling 1-0 win against Manchester City that ensured Chelsea moved to within two points of the league leaders Arsenal, having played a game less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our defensive strategy was brilliant,” Hayes said. “Our ability in the first half to take Man City to the spaces we wanted them to be in worked really, really well. It was a controlled, measured, calm, champion-like performance.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/chelsea-manchester-city-womens-super-league-match-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Celtic’s league surge continues after hammering Motherwell 4-0</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/celtic-surge-continues-after-4-0-league-cruise-at-motherwell-rangers-hearts-scottish-premiership</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Double for Rogic, while Abada and Maeda also on target&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rangers romp past Hearts 5-0 in Sunday’s later match&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Rogic scored a first-half double as &lt;strong&gt;Celtic&lt;/strong&gt; maintained their new position at the top of the Scottish Premiership with an impressive 4-0 victory over &lt;strong&gt;Motherwell&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ange Postecoglou’s side subjected Motherwell to the same first-half demolition that they carried out &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/02/celtic-rangers-scottish-premiership-match-report"&gt;against Rangers in midweek&lt;/a&gt; and again led by three goals at half-time following Liel Abada’s opener and Rogic’s superbly-taken brace. This time Celtic continued their domination after the break and Daizen Maeda rounded off a one-sided win at Fir Park.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/celtic-surge-continues-after-4-0-league-cruise-at-motherwell-rangers-hearts-scottish-premiership"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/bayer-leverkusen-leave-dortmund-hopes-in-tatters-after-5-2-thrashing</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bayern Munich nine points clear at the top of Bundesliga&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only Borussia Dortmund’s second home loss in league&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Borussia Dortmund&lt;/strong&gt; were thrashed 5-2 at home by &lt;strong&gt;Bayer Leverkusen&lt;/strong&gt; in the Bundesliga on Sunday, as their hopes of catching leaders Bayern Munich slipped yet further away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defeat left second-placed Dortmund on 43 points, nine behind Bayern after the champions beat RB Leipzig 3-2 on Saturday. Leverkusen stayed third but reduced the gap with Dortmund to five points.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/bayer-leverkusen-leave-dortmund-hopes-in-tatters-after-5-2-thrashing"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Middlesbrough’s reward for upset is home date with Spurs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Southampton meet West Ham in all-top-flight affair&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Premier League leaders Manchester City will travel to Peterborough in the FA Cup fifth round. It is a plum draw for Posh, who are at this stage of the competition for the first time since 1986 after overcoming Championship rivals QPR on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A host of ties pitch Premier League teams against Championship opposition and Chelsea, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/chelsea-plymouth-fa-cup-match-report"&gt;who suffered a scare&lt;/a&gt; against League One Plymouth, will travel to Luton. Middlesbrough’s reward for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/04/manchester-united-middlesbrough-fa-cup-match-report"&gt;knocking Manchester United out&lt;/a&gt; on penalties at Old Trafford is a home date with Tottenham, who are looking to lift the cup for the first time since 1991.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/fa-cup-fifth-round-draw-luton-host-chelsea-posh-trip-for-manchester-city"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Harry Kane doubles up to steer Tottenham past Brighton in FA Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/tottenham-brighton-fa-cup-match-report</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Exactly the same, yet very different. Tottenham’s FA Cup score of choice this season is seemingly 3-1. But whereas a lacklustre performance against League One Morecambe required Harry Kane to spare blushes from the bench, Brighton were convincingly beaten under the Saturday night lights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kane was again instrumental, bookending the scoring. The England captain took his tally to 25 for club and country in what is supposed to be a season of discontent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/tottenham-brighton-fa-cup-match-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Bowen saves West Ham’s blushes in extra-time Cup win over Kidderminster</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/kidderminster-west-ham-fa-cup-match-report</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Somehow, West Ham slithered out of this barnstorming FA Cup tie with a spot in the fifth round. After Declan Rice, who was sent on by David Moyes at half-time to bring some order to an abject performance, struck in second-half stoppage time to take the game to extra time, Jarrod Bowen prevented penalties after snaffling a winner with 13 seconds left on the clock. Moyes, hands in pockets, was unmoved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kidderminster manager, Russell Penn, could only pull his snood over his face, while his assistant, Jimmy O’Connor, swivelled on the touchline in disbelief. West Ham got out of jail to avoid an embarrassing exit and burst sixth-tier Kidderminster’s bubble, after Alex Penny had sparked delirium by opening the scoring.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/kidderminster-west-ham-fa-cup-match-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>European roundup: Giroud fires Milan to stunning comeback win in derby</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/european-roundup-giroud-fires-milan-to-stunning-comeback-win-in-derby</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Milan a point behind city rivals at top of Serie A after stirring win&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bayern Munich beat RB Leipzig 3-2 thanks to Gvardiol own goal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olivier Giroud scored twice in three minutes to earn &lt;strong&gt;Milan&lt;/strong&gt; a stunning 2-1 comeback win over the Serie A leaders &lt;strong&gt;Inter&lt;/strong&gt; on Saturday, putting the &lt;em&gt;Rossoneri&lt;/em&gt; one point off top as the champions’ 14-match unbeaten league run came to an end. Ivan Perisic put Inter in front at a raucous San Siro late in the first half, breaking Milan’s resistance after their goalkeeper Mike Maignan pulled off two superb saves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Giroud, starting in place of Milan’s injured top scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic, nudged in an equaliser in the 75th minute and then found the bottom corner three minutes later to turn the game on its head. “I was a bit frustrated in the first half, like the whole team, because we didn’t play well and we knew that,” Giroud said afterwards.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/european-roundup-giroud-fires-milan-to-stunning-comeback-win-in-derby"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘These two are real warriors’: Klopp has no fears for return of Mané and Salah</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/two-real-warriors-jurgen-klopp-no-fears-for-return-sadio-mane-mohamed-salah</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Liverpool duo will be on opposing teams in Cup of Nations final&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both could be back for league match with Leicester on Thursday&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jürgen Klopp is confident his “warriors” Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané will be able to process their delight and dejection from the Africa Cup of Nations final and want to get straight back into the battle for the Premier League title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liverpool’s two top scorers of the Klopp era face off on Sunday when Salah captains Egypt against Mané’s Senegal in Yaoundé before they team up again against Leicester on Thursday. The Liverpool manager is convinced that, rather than asking for a break, each will be eager to return to action and, while it is likely one will come back to Merseyside jubilant and the other disappointed, he insisted it is not a test of his man-management skills.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/two-real-warriors-jurgen-klopp-no-fears-for-return-sadio-mane-mohamed-salah"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Chinese official drags Dutch reporter away during live Olympics report – video</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2022/feb/05/chinese-official-drags-dutch-reporter-away-during-live-olympics-report-beijing-video</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Dutch reporter in the middle of a live broadcast was dragged away by a Chinese security official during the Winter Olympic Games' opening ceremony in Beijing on Friday. Footage from Dutch public broadcaster&amp;nbsp;NOS&amp;nbsp;showed several security officials surround Sjoerd den Daas before one of them forcefully grabbed him as he stood not far away from the Bird's Nest stadium in the Chinese capital. 'Unfortunately, this is increasingly the daily reality for journalists in China,' the Dutch outlet later tweeted, adding that Den Daas 'is fine and could fortunately finish his story a few minutes later'. The International Olympic Committee has said this was an isolated event and will not affect foreign media's reporting at the Games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/04/winter-olympics-2022-10-things-to-look-out-for-in-beijing"&gt;Winter Olympics 2022: 10 things to look out for in Beijing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2022/feb/05/chinese-official-drags-dutch-reporter-away-during-live-olympics-report-beijing-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Protesters in the US, India, Turkey and Japan demonstrated against the Chinese government as the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics began. The various groups focused on China's human rights record in Hong Kong, Tibet, south Mongolia and the treatment of Uyghurs. The UK and the US are a part of a diplomatic boycott of the games.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/04/winter-olympics-2022-10-things-to-look-out-for-in-beijing"&gt;Winter Olympics 2022: 10 things to look out for in Beijing&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2022/feb/04/against-all-humanity-protests-mark-start-of-beijing-winter-olympics-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Pillow fighting: yes, it's professional combat sport – video</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2022/feb/04/pillow-fighting-yes-its-professional-combat-sport-video</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;'There’s just something so cathartic about getting hit in the head with a pillow,' says entrepreneur Steve Williams, who has created the Pillow Fight Championships (PFC), and even organised a pay-per-view event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Described as 'hardcore swinging with specialised pillows', the PFC sees competitors – who include active MMA fighters, reality TV stars, bare-knuckle boxers, mechanics, single moms and veterinarians – win by hitting their opponent in the head the most across three 90-second rounds. Brazilian Istela Nunes and American Hauley Tillman were crowned the inaugural PFC champions last weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'You don’t really need to explain [pillow fighting] to people – that’s the beauty,' says Williams. As he sees it, pillow fighting is not just a gimmick: 'There’s hardcore aggression with pillow fighting, but nobody gets hurt. A lot of people don’t want to see the blood and violence any more.'&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2022/feb/04/pillow-fighting-yes-its-professional-combat-sport-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The former world heavyweight boxing champion Wladimir Klitschko has signed up for Ukraine's reserve army, saying he 'can't stand still' amid the country's geopolitical crisis with Russia. His brother, Vitali Klitschko, also a former heavyweight boxer and now Mayor of Kyiv, says they are preparing 'to take weapons in our own hands' should war break out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/kremlin-call-boris-johnson-ukraine-diplomacy-effort-utterly-confused-protect-russian-invasion"&gt;Kremlin calls Boris Johnson’s Ukraine diplomacy efforts ‘utterly confused’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2022/feb/02/i-cant-stand-still-wladimir-klitschko-signs-up-for-ukraines-reserve-army-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lea United goalkeeper Dominick Jolly scored a spectacular overhead kick in the dying moments of his side's derby clash with Ribbleton Warriors.

      <title>Emotional Rafael Nadal reflects after 'unforgettable' Australian Open win – video</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2022/jan/31/emotional-rafael-nadal-reflects-after-unforgettable-australian-open-win-video</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Spaniard fought from two sets down to beat Daniil Medvedev in an epic Australian Open final for a record-breaking 21st grand slam title. Nadal overtakes Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the holder of the most grand slam victories in the men's game. The match was the second longest grand slam final in history, lasting five hours and 24 minutes, 30 minutes shorter than the 2012 final at Melbourne Park, when Nadal lost to Djokovic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nadal revealed that he 'fought a lot to be back on court', while saying he was unsure whether he would be able to compete at the Australian Open&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/30/australian-open-tennis-rafael-nadal-daniil-medvedev-match-report"&gt;Rafael Nadal beats Medvedev in epic Australian Open final to claim 21st slam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2022/jan/31/emotional-rafael-nadal-reflects-after-unforgettable-australian-open-win-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Fiver | Carlos Queiroz and Egypt’s declaration of war on Afcon officialdom</title>

Sign up now!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lead-up to Thursday night’s Afcon semi-final between Cameroon and Egypt, a minor exchange of views broke out between Samuel Eto’o and Carlos Queiroz. Eto’o, formerly Cameroon’s star striker and now president of their federation, referred to the upcoming match as a “war”, causing Egypt coach Queiroz to respond philosophically. “Football is not about war,” he insisted. “Football is about celebration, it’s about joy, it’s about happiness.” And so the moment those words left his lips, it instantly became inevitable that Queiroz would spend the duration of the game on a rolling boil, a bain-marie of belligerence whose bellicosity would make Vladimir Putin sound like a member of the Beatles in 1967.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/04/the-fiver-carlos-queiroz-on-a-rolling-boil-egypt-afcon"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;France are clear favourites but Ireland, Scotland, England and defending champions Wales all have high hopes of challenging&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disruption that has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/30/joe-marchant-fails-covid-test-latest-blow-to-england-six-nations-plans"&gt;blighted England’s buildup&lt;/a&gt; must be seen in the context of the size of the player pool available to Eddie Jones, but the fact that more than half the backs in the training squad – not to mention a handful of forwards – have never played in the Six Nations demonstrates the uncertainty with which their campaign begins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/01/state-of-the-unions-six-nations-2022-team-by-team-prospects"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Spin | Patrick Foster’s gambling caution: ‘Quite a few in cricket need help’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/02/patrick-foster-gambling-caution-quite-a-few-in-cricket-need-help-the-spin</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;He blew money and a career in the game and now the former Northants player wants others to learn from his mistakes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one knew why Patrick Foster wasn’t performing better – he should, by rights, have been the star player for his club. Foster had been signed by Northamptonshire in his teens, developing through their academy and second XI. As a student at Durham University, he was mentored by Graeme Fowler and by his early 20s he had played against and alongside the likes of Virat Kohli, Josh Lalor and Dawid Malan. Even now, his teammates at Oxford’s Horspath CC would still see the occasional flash of the former professional’s undeniable talent; the problem was, he didn’t seem to be trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 27-year-old Foster batted recklessly, like someone working off their anger issues, or trying to get out as quickly as possible. Bowling – his specialism – seemed a chore, and he was unengaged in the field, preferring to stay out on the boundary. There didn’t seem much team spirit about him either. The young man spent most of the lunch and tea breaks on his phone, and his commitment was increasingly flaky. For someone who had once been desperate to play cricket for a living, he always seemed to have a reason why he couldn’t make the next fixture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/02/patrick-foster-gambling-caution-quite-a-few-in-cricket-need-help-the-spin"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

Are there any equivalents from other countries? For the purposes of this, the 2002 League Cup is a major trophy.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Though organised football was more or less restricted to these islands in the 19th century there are a number of other clubs who can match or better Blackburn’s achievement,” begins Sean DeLoughry. “Celtic, Rangers, Linfield and Glentoran have won every major domestic competition available to them each century. Additionally, Hibernian, Hearts, Bangor, Distillery and Cliftonville have racked up major honours in each century. Here’s an overview:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;England&lt;/strong&gt;: Blackburn (19th Century Cup, 20th Century League/Cup, 21st Century LC)&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scotland: &lt;/strong&gt;Celtic (19C League/Cup, 20C League/Cup/LC, 21C League/Cup/LC), Hearts (19C League/Cup, 20C League/Cup/LC, 21C Cup), Hibernian (19C Cup, 20C League/Cup/LC, 21C Cup/LC), Rangers (19C League/Cup, 20C League/Cup/LC, 21C League/Cup/LC)&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wales: &lt;/strong&gt;Bangor (19C Cup, 20C League/Cup, 21C League/Cup)&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/strong&gt; Cliftonville (19C Cup, 20C League/Cup, 21C League/LC), Distillery (19C League/Cup, 20C League/Cup, 21C LC), Glentoran (19C League/Cup, 20C League/Cup/LC, 21C League/Cup/LC), Linfield (19C League/Cup, 20C League/Cup/LC, 21C League/Cup/LC)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/02/which-football-clubs-have-won-major-trophies-across-three-centuries"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Talking Horses: listen to jockeys in battle of the scales with racing’s rulers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The latest war of words between the jockeys’ association and the British Horseracing Authority is unlikely to be the last&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another week, another war of words between the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) and the Professional Jockeys Association (PJA): two bodies which seem to be, for the moment at least, in a state of perpetual antipathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest dispute concerns the BHA’s announcement last week that the 3lb Covid allowance for riders, which has been in place since June 2020, will be replaced by a general 2lb rise in the weights from 26 March. The allowance was introduced when racing emerged from lockdown in June 2020, but with weighing-room saunas off-limits to maintain social distancing. Jockeys – or the 250 or so who responded to a survey – subsequently voted to keep the saunas closed, but apparently in the expectation that the 3lb allowance would be retained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/jan/31/talking-horses-listen-to-jockeys-in-battle-of-the-scales-with-racings-rulers-horse-racing-tips"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Classic YouTube in 2021: Raducanu’s glory and the Cavendish comeback</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/23/classic-youtube-in-2021-raducanus-glory-and-the-cavendish-comeback</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Euro 2020, Tokyo 2020 and Rachael Blackmore’s historic Grand National win feature in our selection of the year’s best videos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) The best moment for British sport in 2021? It’s very likely to be &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIUfjnBG-Yc"&gt;Emma Raducanu winning the US Open&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the first qualifier to capture a grand slam title. That’s with apologies to Mark Cavendish, who came back from almost retiring from racing to win four stages at the Tour de France and the green jersey and become, alongside Eddy Merckx, the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJh4x2g8nQI"&gt;winner of the most stages at Le Tour&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNT-IHxEglc"&gt;GC winner was the irresistible Tadej Pogacar&lt;/a&gt;. At the Tokyo Olympics, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrffI0HjlEE"&gt;Team GB won a mighty 65 medals,&lt;/a&gt; finishing fourth in the medals table,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) The social team at the Olympics have kindly edited together a 10-minute clip of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjIU8lSNTy4"&gt;some of the best moments of Tokyo 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luJGosl3CxQ"&gt;the opening ceremony&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8N2QSM_s3Zo"&gt;closing ceremony, too&lt;/a&gt;, both taking place in front of an empty Olympic Stadium. For the host nation &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gqyObSO5tU"&gt;perhaps the women’s skateboarding&lt;/a&gt; was the highlight, with two 13-year-olds medallists and a 16-year-old, too. And world records in both &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n48P9pSIQKs"&gt;the men’s&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BTOqOqSR-k"&gt;women’s 400m hurdles finals&lt;/a&gt; from Karsten Warholm and Sydney McLaughlin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/23/classic-youtube-in-2021-raducanus-glory-and-the-cavendish-comeback"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Winter Olympics 2022: 10 things to look out for in Beijing</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/04/winter-olympics-2022-10-things-to-look-out-for-in-beijing</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jamaica return to the bobsleigh after 24 years, Haiti and Saudi Arabia make debuts, while GB aim for curling glory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jamaica will enter a four-man bobsleigh team in the Olympics for the first time in 24 years after nicking the final qualifying spot, offering a feelgood reboot for the island nation whose debut at the 1988 Calgary Games inspired the Disney film Cool Runnings. Just making it to Beijing might seem like accomplishment enough for Shanwayne Stephens, the team’s 31-year-old pilot and Royal Air Force lance corporal who emigrated to Great Britain with his family in 2002: certainly after improvised training methods at the height of the pandemic that included pushing his girlfriend’s Mini Cooper around the streets of Peterborough. But having touched down in China after &lt;a href="https://www.teambath.com/2022/01/25/jamaica-bobsleigh-team/"&gt;undergoing their final preparations&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Bath, his goal is plain. “It’s got to be medalling,” Stephens says. “It’s everybody’s dream, it’s what we’re here to do. So why not aim high?” &lt;strong&gt;BAG&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/04/winter-olympics-2022-10-things-to-look-out-for-in-beijing"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Lewis Hamilton’s future shrouded in doubt as new F1 season looms | Giles Richards</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/03/lewis-hamiltons-future-shrouded-in-doubt-as-new-f1-season-looms</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Little has been heard from Hamilton since he lost his crown to Max Verstappen in controversial circumstances&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a tumultuous climax to the 2021 Formula One season that ended in both sound and fury, it is Lewis Hamilton’s continued silence that has defined the winter. With the new season rapidly approaching, the British driver’s future in F1 remains unknown and ostensibly undecided. As the FIA wrestles with an inquiry into the events in Abu Dhabi, it is Hamilton’s absence that looms over the sport, his silence speaking volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven times an F1 world champion but beaten to the title in controversial circumstances at the season finale at Yas Marina by Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, Hamilton left Abu Dhabi angry and disillusioned. He believed the race had been manipulated in Verstappen’s favour and so disenchanted was he with the way it had played out, he had lost trust in the rules being applied fairly. His Mercedes principal, Toto Wolff, confirmed shortly afterwards that his future in F1 was in doubt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/03/lewis-hamiltons-future-shrouded-in-doubt-as-new-f1-season-looms"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Skier Gus Kenworthy: ‘My legacy in Pyeongchang was that kiss – to have it broadcast to the world felt amazing’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/03/skier-gus-kenworthy-my-legacy-in-pyeongchang-was-that-kiss-to-have-it-broadcast-to-the-world-felt-amazing</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 30-year-old on the toll of not living as his ‘true self’ before coming out, switching to Team GB and unease at China hosting the Winter Olympics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘I think of that person, or look at photos of that person, and it feels like a lifetime ago,” Gus Kenworthy says as he remembers &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/guskenworthy/videos/throwback-to-the-run-that-got-me-a-silver-medal-in-sochi-in-2014-im-about-to-boa/1915828065124933/" title=""&gt;winning a silver medal for the United States&lt;/a&gt; as a freestyle skier at his first Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014. So much has changed since then. He is now about &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-50652615" title=""&gt;to compete for Great Britain&lt;/a&gt;, the country of his birth, in his third and final Olympics in Beijing and Kenworthy will ski as a gay man, an LGBTQ+ activist and an actor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important facet of his transition is that, as Kenworthy says: “I’m just much happier now than I was back then when I wasn’t living my life authentically. I wasn’t being my true self and it definitely took a toll.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/03/skier-gus-kenworthy-my-legacy-in-pyeongchang-was-that-kiss-to-have-it-broadcast-to-the-world-felt-amazing"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>If owners really paid coaches bonuses to lose, the NFL is in big trouble</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/03/nfl-tanking-allegations-owner-payments-brian-flores-hue-jackson</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The league manages to slither out of every controversy that comes its way. But allegations that hit the integrity of the game itself are a different matter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Super Bowl, the NFL’s ultimate coronation and &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/top-rated-shows-2021-ncis-yellowstone-squid-game-1235143671/"&gt;by far the most watched event&lt;/a&gt; in America, is a little over a week away.

One, even though many of these players strive to become coaches and executives in the league upon retirement. Thirty-two teams.
