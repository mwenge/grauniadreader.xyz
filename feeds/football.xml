      <title>‘My players deserve this’: Boreham Wood turn focus to Lampard’s Everton</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/07/boreham-wood-lampard-everton-fa-cup-bournemouth</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Non-league club have earned £500,000 in FA Cup after beating Bournemouth but creating memories is always the main goal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Luke Garrard, it was all about creating a moment, a rush of joy, something to remember for ever and, given the odds against his Boreham Wood team in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/bournemouth-boreham-wood-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report" title=""&gt;the FA Cup fourth round at Bournemouth&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, the manager would have taken anything – and especially a goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garrard got that and what a story it was for the captain, Mark Ricketts, at 37 years young, when he threaded home a low sidefoot on 38 minutes to give the National League side the lead. Ricketts had not trained from Tuesday to Friday and he did the bare minimum on Saturday as he nursed an injury that needed an injection last Monday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/07/boreham-wood-lampard-everton-fa-cup-bournemouth"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Chelsea settle historical racist abuse case brought by former players</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/07/chelsea-settle-historical-racist-abuse-case-brought-by-former-players</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Premier League club settles case with four former youth players&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Players alleged they were abused by two coaches in the 1990s&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chelsea have settled a high court case brought by four former youth-team players over &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/17/police-investigate-allegation-racist-abuse-chelsea-youth-historical"&gt;alleged historical racist abuse&lt;/a&gt;. The men had sought damages for personal injury and loss over claims they were “subjected to a barrage of disgracefully offensive racist abuse” from two members of the Premier League club’s youth coaching staff in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the men claimed Chelsea were “vicariously liable” for abuse allegedly committed when they were aged between 14 and 18. It was also alleged in court documents that one coach “would accompany that verbal abuse with physical assaults of a sexual nature”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/07/chelsea-settle-historical-racist-abuse-case-brought-by-former-players"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘I don’t care what he wears’ – Frank Lampard hits back at Dele Alli criticism</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/07/i-dont-care-what-he-wears-frank-lampard-hits-back-at-dele-alli-criticism</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Everton manager defends player over clothes and car critique&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;‘The modern day has moved on, we all have to be aware of that’&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frank Lampard has said he will judge Dele Alli on what he produces for Everton and not on his choice of clothes or car. The new signing has received strange criticism since his deadline day move from Tottenham with Alan Brazil questioning his use of a Rolls-Royce and the former England manager Glenn Hoddle faulting the clothes he wore at &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/everton-brentford-fa-cup-match-report"&gt;Goodison Park on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While admitting the pundits have a right to their opinion, the new Everton manager said he would not “handcuff” the midfielder’s personality and is more concerned with the 25-year-old’s efforts to relaunch his career than lifestyle choices. Alli, and his fellow new recruit Donny van de Beek, are in the Everton squad for the Premier League trip to Newcastle on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/07/i-dont-care-what-he-wears-frank-lampard-hits-back-at-dele-alli-criticism"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>From game on to game over? Sevilla rue what might have been in La Liga | Sid Lowe</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/07/from-game-on-to-game-over-sevilla-rue-what-might-have-been-in-la-liga</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The title candidates who just won’t let go couldn’t quite hold on either, leaving Madrid six points clear on top&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ivan Rakitic had the ball in his hands and Sevilla’s fate in them too, or at least that’s how it felt. On moments like this titles turn, so it goes. They had spent the last two months hanging in there, the team still standing even as players were falling, clinging on for a chance like this. But time was running out on the first day of the rest of their season, the opportunity they had waited for untaken and slipping away again. Until suddenly, almost out of nothing, it was given back. All they now had to do was score a last-minute penalty and they really would be in the race for La Liga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah,&lt;em&gt; all. &lt;/em&gt;And no, they didn’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/07/from-game-on-to-game-over-sevilla-rue-what-might-have-been-in-la-liga"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Giroud shrugs off shirt curse to put Milan on cloud nine in derby victory | Nicky Bandini</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/07/giroud-shrugs-off-shirt-curse-to-put-milan-on-cloud-nine-in-derby-victory</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Forward turned the derby on its head with a quickfire double that breathed life into the title race – and the dreaded No 9 shirt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even Olivier Giroud was starting to wonder if he might have jinxed himself. The Frenchman had no hesitation in accepting Milan’s No 9 shirt after he joined last summer, shrugging off the fact that no player in a decade had hit double figures while wearing it in Serie A. Ten players had tried and failed – among them such talented goalscorers as Gonzalo Higuaín, Fernando Torres and André Silva – but Giroud insisted: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/oct/18/inside-no-9-no-hexes-yet-for-giroud-as-verona-lose-voice-in-milan-again"&gt;“I’m not superstitious.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the turn of the year, he was sounding a little less confident. “I don’t believe in the curse of the No 9 shirt,” he told Milan’s in-house TV station in January. “But I have thought about it a few times after all these physical issues I’ve been having.” Giroud had begun confidently, scoring twice in his home debut: a 4-1 win over Cagliari. Since then, though, his season had been a constant stop-start. He missed time due to Covid, then lower back pain, then a hamstring injury. Prior to Saturday’s derby against Inter, he had started seven league games in six months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/07/giroud-shrugs-off-shirt-curse-to-put-milan-on-cloud-nine-in-derby-victory"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

Sign up now!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you do, fellow kids? Now, The Fiver knows all about #hashtags on the social media disgraces but not everyone is quite as savvy as your much-loved tea-timely missive, so here’s a quick guide for the uninitiated: #scenes means someone has scored a goal, #awaydays is fairly self-explanatory and usually accompanied by a photo of a four-pack of Tin on a 10am train, and when people talk about #limbs they’re usually referring to the variety of flailing appendages in the stands [oh, behave – Carry on Ed] as fans cavort in wild celebration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/07/a-quick-guide-to-football-hashtags-on-the-social-media-disgraces"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>UK and Ireland to launch bid for Euro 2028 after ditching World Cup plans</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Joint bid for 2030 World Cup abandoned due to ‘uncertainty’&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UK government expected to back plans to host Euro 2028&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The home nations and Ireland are to launch a joint bid for the men’s European Championship in 2028 after plans to host the 2030 World Cup were abandoned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision was made after a feasibility study into the 2030 tournament found “many areas of uncertainty” according to the Football Association’s chief executive, Mark Bullingham. A 2030 bid was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/sep/29/uk-ireland-bid-2030-world-cup-theresa-may-government-support" title=""&gt;proposed by the Conservative government&lt;/a&gt; in its 2019 manifesto and was described last year as “the right time” to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/mar/02/boris-johnson-pledges-28m-towards-british-and-irish-bid-for-2030-world-cup" title=""&gt;“bring football home”&lt;/a&gt; by the prime minister, Boris Johnson.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/07/uk-and-ireland-to-launch-bid-for-euro-2028-after-ditching-world-cup-plans"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>FA Cup: 10 talking points from the weekend’s fourth-round action</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/07/fa-cup-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-fourth-round-action</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The rarity of a manager agreeing with referees, Luton get just reward and Everton respond well to Lampard’s arrival&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barring a Thomas Tuchel-style Champions League triumph that seems about as likely as Bryan Robson mounting a comeback in Manchester United’s midfield, Ralf Rangnick’s candidacy for the full-time manager’s role is probably at an end after exiting the FA Cup to Middlesbrough. Should he even want it, a flaw in the plan is becoming apparent. Rangnick was reported at the weekend to have taken on a PR advisor for his six months as interim manager before a two-year consultancy role that will involve working with the next, “permanent” boss. That Rangnick has been unable to arrest much of the slide that occurred under Ole Gunnar Solskjær does his credibility in that future role little good, though a few leading football men can say that after involvement with United in recent years. The FA Cup may have lost its former importance but five years without a trophy is significant, a key indicator that the slump is long past a blip. &lt;strong&gt;John Brewin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Report: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/04/manchester-united-middlesbrough-fa-cup-match-report"&gt;Man Utd 1-1 Middlesbrough (Boro win 7-6 on pens)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Match report: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/kidderminster-west-ham-fa-cup-match-report"&gt;Kidderminster 1-2 West Ham (aet)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Match report: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/chelsea-plymouth-fa-cup-match-report"&gt;Chelsea 2-1 Plymouth (aet)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Match report: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/crystal-palace-hartlepool-fa-cup-match-report"&gt;Crystal Palace 2-0 Hartlepool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Match report: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/everton-brentford-fa-cup-match-report"&gt;Everton 4-1 Brentford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/07/fa-cup-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-fourth-round-action"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Women’s Super League: talking points from the weekend’s action</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/07/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chelsea close the gap to Arsenal at the top of the table but Birmingham look doomed after narrow defeat by Leicester&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Manchester City manager, Gareth Taylor, said his team deserved a point from Sunday’s 1-0 defeat to Chelsea. Perhaps they did and had Chelsea conceded there would have been few complaints with the final outcome. However, while City upped the ante in the later stages the home team did not at any point look rattled. This was a controlled Chelsea performance. One which denied potent wingers Lauren Hemp and Jess Park room and stopped the final pass reaching Khadija Shaw and, later, her replacement Ellen White. “I think we were diligent out of possession. Our defensive strategy was brilliant,” said Emma Hayes. “Our ability in the first half to take Man City to the spaces we wanted them to be in worked really, really well. Second half I made a change in terms of where I wanted them to go. I didn’t want [Alex] Greenwood on the ball as much.” Yes, City had spells of control, but these were managed spells, with Chelsea almost urging the visitors to come at them. &lt;strong&gt;SW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Match report: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/chelsea-manchester-city-womens-super-league-match-report"&gt;Chelsea 1-0 Manchester City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/02/everton-women-sack-jean-luc-vasseur-after-10-games-in-charge-manager"&gt;Everton sack Jean-Luc Vasseur after 10 games in charge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Match report: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/arsenal-manchester-united-wsl-match-report"&gt;Arsenal 1-1 Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/07/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Denise Clair condemns ‘silence’ of Scottish FA after footballer found to have committed rape in 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is “shameful” that David Goodwillie was allowed to continue playing football after being found by a court to have committed rape, the woman he assaulted has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denise Clair hit out at the footballing authorities, accusing them of being “complicit” with their “silence”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/06/shameful-to-let-david-goodwillie-keep-playing-says-woman-he-assaulted"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Nottingham Forest stun Leicester as FA investigates fan’s attack on players</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Twenty-five miles, 18 places and one division may separate Nottingham Forest from Leicester City but ultimately it was the crazy two minutes in the first half that exemplified the difference between these East Midlands rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was the time between goals from Philip Zinckernagel and Brennan Johnson as Forest, from the Championship, deservedly knocked out FA Cup winners for the second round in succession to land a fifth-round tie at home to Huddersfield Town.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/nottingham-forest-leicester-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Mané scores decisive penalty as Senegal beat Egypt to win Africa Cup of Nations</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/senegal-egypt-africa-cup-of-nations-final-match-report</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was a dreadful final to end a largely dreadful tournament but in the end it came down to a moment of the purest drama and the great redemption of Sadio Mané. He had missed a penalty in normal time. Senegal had wasted chance after chance. They had twice lost in finals before. Egypt are the kings of penalties. They had won their last six shootouts and had played for penalties from the off. But Mané, unexpectedly, was left with a penalty to win it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not just that Abou Gabal had saved his earlier penalty, apparently after Mohamed Salah, Mané’s Liverpool teammate, had told him which way to dive. Mané had also missed against Kenya and Uganda in 2019 and, more consequently, the decisive kick in the quarter-final shootout against Cameroon in the quarter-final in 2017. And Abou Gabal had already saved five penalties in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/senegal-egypt-africa-cup-of-nations-final-match-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Klopp hails ‘proper fairytale’ of Harvey Elliott’s comeback goal for Liverpool</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teenager scored against Cardiff in first game since horror injury&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Klopp: ‘When we lost him it was one of my hardest moments’&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jürgen Klopp savoured the “proper fairytale” of Harvey Elliott’s Liverpool comeback as the teenager scored his first goal for the club, 21 weeks after suffering a dislocated ankle, in a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/liverpool-cardiff-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report"&gt;3-1 win against Cardiff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elliott was taken off on a stretcher in Liverpool’s September win at Leeds, prompting fears for his future in an injury of such apparent severity that Klopp declared it was one of his worst moments in the game. But the winger scored a high-class goal, 18 minutes into his return, while the debutant Luis Díaz began his Liverpool career with an assist for Takumi Minamino’s strike.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/klopp-hails-proper-fairytale-of-harvey-elliotts-comeback-goal-for-liverpool"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Nagelsmann v Tedesco lives up to hype as Leipzig push Bayern all the way | Andy Brassell</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/07/nagelsmann-v-tedesco-does-not-disappoint-as-leipzig-push-bayern-all-way</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Leipzig’s leader showed why he outscored Nagelsmann at coaching school and hinted at a brighter future for club&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julian Nagelsmann has missed this kind of competition and so, in recent months, has the Bundesliga. This felt just like a Saturday night Top-Spiel should, a meeting of minds, of wills, of guts. RB Leipzig have not shone this season like the upstarts they have been since promotion in 2016 – they have been “playing below their potential … it’s no secret”. as Thomas Müller put it at full-time – but they came to Bayern Munich with what a lot of teams leave at home. Hunger and bravery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a weekend when Borussia Dortmund underlined that their nominal title challenge is barely even that, this was a ray of light tentatively pointing towards a more competitive future race at the top. Germany’s football critics relished it too. “The fact that [Domenico] Tedesco’s team had stood up to Bayern for so long with a courageous and attacking approach was remarkable,” wrote Süddeutsche Zeitung’s Philipp Schneider.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/07/nagelsmann-v-tedesco-does-not-disappoint-as-leipzig-push-bayern-all-way"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The race for Champions League places in Ligue 1 will be decided by tactics</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/07/ligue-1-race-champions-league-places-decided-tactics-managers</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With talent spread so evenly among clubs, the tactical choices taken by managers become especially important&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_adam_white_?lang=en"&gt;Adam White&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/"&gt;Get French Football News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The search for identity has defined this Ligue 1 season. Eight of the top nine clubs in the league last season changed their managers in 2021, and every club that was in Ligue 1 at the point of the Covid shutdown in 2020 has subsequently changed their head coach. French football is in a state of flux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new coaches have brought fresh ideas to the league. Previously, teams tended to lean into Ligue 1’s underlying physicality and often stoic mindset, especially in the bottom half of the table, but there has been a dramatic tactical revolution in the last two seasons. More robust teams have disappeared, replaced by fluid and versatile sides.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/07/ligue-1-race-champions-league-places-decided-tactics-managers"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The end of an era: football programmes – outdated or great pieces of history? | Elis James</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/07/the-end-of-an-era-football-programmes-outdated-or-great-pieces-of-history</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As more clubs move these once-essential documents online, there is a tough decision to be made regarding the future of a printed collection of Swansea City past&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have recently upgraded my living arrangements from a flat with an attic but no garden to a house with a garden but no attic. Unfortunately, in London my ideal set-up of a house with an attic &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;a garden costs around £28m, but moving to a place with no storage in the loft means I’m forced to confront a problem that has been nagging away at me for years – what to do with my old football programmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearing the attic before the big move should be relatively easy. I have no sentimental attachment to the Nutribullet my brother-in-law bought me three years ago, I am quite content to throw the gigantic, mosaic-tiled mirror my partner was given by her best friend as a 30th birthday present into a disused canal and I can live without Christmas decorations. But throwing out hundreds of largely worthless football programmes from the matches I’ve attended since I was a child will prove more challenging. If I hadn’t got round to buying a programme for the Wales v Jamaica friendly Wales played against Jamaica at Ninian Park in March 1998 would I regret it? No, of course not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/07/the-end-of-an-era-football-programmes-outdated-or-great-pieces-of-history"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘We play to forget what happened’: football’s refuge for girls who fled atrocities</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/football-refuge-for-girls-who-fled-atrocities-minawao-refugee-camp-cameroon</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Cameroon’s Minawao refugee camp, young Nigerians use the game to help rebuild lives put in danger by Boko Haram&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucy is the team’s captain, so she looks after the ball. Her family’s house is about 10 minutes’ walk from the pitch: it is one of the more established dwellings in Minawao, a permanent structure largely screened behind a high mud wall. She greets her mother, who is sitting outside with an aunt, in Hausa before disappearing inside. Once she has retrieved what she came for, the day’s training can begin. “We play football with our friends to ease our minds,” she says. “That’s why they give girls this ball to play with: to forget about what happened to us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could barely seem further from Yaounde, where the Africa Cup of Nations final will take place on Sunday. We are 500 miles away in Cameroon’s extreme north region, tropical greenery having given way to the parched fringes of the Sahel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/football-refuge-for-girls-who-fled-atrocities-minawao-refugee-camp-cameroon"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Darkest moment in our history’: Raith fans on David Goodwillie row</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/darkest-moment-in-our-history-raith-rovers-fans-david-goodwillie-row</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scottish club have U-turned on decision to sign player ruled to be a rapist in civil court. But for some the damage is done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing Martin Glass thought about was his daughter, when he heard the news on Monday evening that his home town team, Raith Rovers, were signing a man &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/01/raith-rovers-womens-captain-resigns-amid-fury-over-david-goodwillie-signing"&gt;ruled to be a rapist by a civil court&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lillie is just seven and a half months old but 26-year-old Glass is a first-time dad and he’s already looking forward to taking her to her first game. “I want my daughter to have good role models. If I’m part of a club that has a rapist as an idol then that’s on me.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/darkest-moment-in-our-history-raith-rovers-fans-david-goodwillie-row"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jurgen Klopp described Harvey Elliott's goal-scoring return to football as a 'fairytale' after his side's 3-1 FA Cup fourth-round win against Cardiff City. The 18-year-old had not played a competitive match in 147 days, having&amp;nbsp;been stretchered off against Leeds United and rushed to hospital with a serious ankle injury. Elliott scored after 18 minutes, his first goal for Liverpool, a moment Klopp described as 'touching'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/klopp-hails-proper-fairytale-of-harvey-elliotts-comeback-goal-for-liverpool"&gt;Klopp hails ‘proper fairytale’ of Harvey Elliott’s comeback goal for Liverpool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/liverpool-cardiff-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report"&gt;Harvey Elliott caps return from injury by sealing win for Liverpool over Cardiff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2022/feb/06/a-proper-fairytale-liverpools-jurgen-klopp-on-harvey-elliotts-goalscoring-return-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

This was the first goal of the game, with Clevedon Town winning 4-2&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2022/jan/23/oh-hello-clevedon-town-player-scores-non-league-goal-of-the-season-contender-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>'I didn't expect him to hug me': Rangnick on Ronaldo's reaction to substitution – video</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ralf Rangnick was forced to explain to Cristiano Ronaldo why he was substituted after the forward questioned his decision during Manchester United’s 3-1 win at Brentford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'It was the right decision. Cristiano is a goalscorer but it was more important to be compact at this moment,' Rangnick said after the game. 'I have no issues whatsoever with Cristiano. I’ve been here six weeks and never had any issue with him – none whatsoever.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/19/ronaldo-replaced-for-good-of-manchester-united-says-rangnick"&gt;Rangnick told Ronaldo he withdrew him ‘in the interests’ of Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2022/jan/20/i-didnt-expect-him-to-hug-me-rangnick-on-ronaldos-reaction-to-substitution-video"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Australian football must broaden its scope if Socceroos and Matildas are to exit current mire | Joey Lynch</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/08/australian-football-must-broaden-its-scope-if-socceroos-and-matildas-are-to-exit-current-mire</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The national sides’ recent travails have highlighted the need for more ego in Australian football&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contrast in fortunes could hardly have been more distinct. On one side of the stage was Ange Postecoglou, basking in the adoration of 60,000 Celtic fans after an Old Firm triumph, and Alen Stajčić, brow furrowed in concentration, as his underdog Philippines advanced to the semi-finals of the Asian Cup. On the other was Graham Arnold, glumly musing on belief, hard work and goal differences as the Socceroos’ chances of automatic qualification for Qatar 2022 were &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/02/world-cup-doomsday-scenario-looms-after-socceroos-slip-up-in-oman"&gt;all but ended&lt;/a&gt;, and Tony Gustavsson putting a brave face on the Matildas’ &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/31/no-sugar-coating-disastrous-matildas-asian-cup-failure"&gt;disastrous elimination&lt;/a&gt; from the Asian Cup and speaking of effort, learning and his belief that he could bounce back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dichotomy was obvious enough that it quickly became a key part of the fallout of a calamitous week; the inference being that had the former pair remained in charge of the national teams, or if Gustavsson and Arnold had not been put there, things would have been vastly different. This just might be accurate, but it could also be widely off the mark. The handy thing about hypotheticals is that they never need to be proven right or wrong. But there has certainly been some level of revisionism surrounding both national teams’ history as of late.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/08/australian-football-must-broaden-its-scope-if-socceroos-and-matildas-are-to-exit-current-mire"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Afghanistan women’s football team reunite with hopes of competing in Australia | Joey Lynch</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/afghanistan-womens-football-team-reunite-with-hopes-of-competing-in-australia</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the first time since fleeing their home and finding sanctuary in Australia, the team are taking their battle for equality onto the field&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early on a suitably idyllic Melbourne morning, 18 Afghan footballers and one referee took to the field at the Darebin International Sports Centre. The group were training under the banner of their nation’s women’s team for the first time since being forced to flee their homeland last August. It was an innocuous session, featuring the warm-ups, drills and team talks replicated at grounds around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there was a palpable sense of joy on display. Though a few have played games here and there since they were granted asylum, Saturday’s session was the first time the team – which was “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/aug/20/khalida-popal-afghanistan-womens-football-team-built-to-fight-taliban-ideology"&gt;built to fight&lt;/a&gt;” the Taliban’s ideology – had joined together since they sat on the floor of a crowded plane as it took off from Hamid Karzai airport, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/24/female-athletes-from-afghanistan-leave-kabul-airport-after-being-granted-australian-visas"&gt;fleeing Kabul&lt;/a&gt; alongside more than 75 other players, relatives and team officials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/05/afghanistan-womens-football-team-reunite-with-hopes-of-competing-in-australia"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Lessons from Concacaf qualifying: US insecurity in the cold and Canada’s surge</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/03/concacaf-world-cup-qualifying-soccer-usmnt-canada</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Canada are all but assured of a place at Qatar 2022 but US Soccer’s decision to play the weakest team in the group in freezing conditions was an odd one&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wound from the failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup is still raw, elite sport is a business of marginal gains and the USMNT is often forced to play road games in heat, humidity and at altitude. But the choice of freezing St Paul for this game exuded insecurity when the US should have projected strength.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/03/concacaf-world-cup-qualifying-soccer-usmnt-canada"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Athletic Bilbao strike late to send Real Madrid crashing out of Copa del Rey</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/03/athletic-bilbao-real-madrid-copa-del-rey</link>
      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Álex Berenguer’s 89th-minute winner settles quarter-final&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Athletic follow up win over Barcelona with another upset&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athletic Bilbao sent Real Madrid crashing out of the Copa del Rey thanks to a stunning last-minute strike by substitute Álex Berenguer at San Mamés.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berenguer’s goal in the 89th minute secured a surprise 1-0 victory in the quarter-finals, as Marcelino’s side followed up &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/20/copa-del-rey-athletic-bilbao-barcelona-real-madrid-elche"&gt;their last-16 win over Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; with another unexpected result. It was a deserved breakthrough for the hosts, who had been the stronger side for much of the contest, and made up for defeats to Real in the Spanish Super Cup final and two recent La Liga matches.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/03/athletic-bilbao-real-madrid-copa-del-rey"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Ligue 1 transfers driven by relegation fears rather than title hopes</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/02/ligue-1-transfers-relegation-fears-title-january-window</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The top sides were quiet in the January window, leaving the big spending to clubs that are trying to avoid the drop&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericdevin_"&gt;Eric Devin&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="http://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/"&gt;Get French Football News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the January transfer window drifted to its close, the narrative across France was one of survival, rather than improvement. The most active clubs in Ligue 1 were those who are trying to stay in the division, rather than those jockeying for a place in the Champions League. None of the clubs occupying the European places made significant additions, leaving the heavy lifting to those hoping to avoid the drop, with St-Étienne, Bordeaux and Troyes all notably active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the league title seemingly sewn up but uncertainty lingering over their form in Europe, to say nothing of their Coupe de France exit on Monday against Nice, PSG looked likely to be active in the market. There were plenty of mooted exits, from Georginio Wijnaldum to Colin Dagba, but in the end they were only able to see off Rafinha and Sergio Rico, both on loan. Moves for Tanguy Ndombele and Ousmane Dembélé did not materialise, leaving Mauricio Pochettino with the same conundrum he faced before January: a bloated squad that, despite its obvious gifts, will probably fall short in Europe once again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/02/ligue-1-transfers-relegation-fears-title-january-window"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>World Cup doomsday scenario looms after Socceroos slip up in Oman | Joey Lynch</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/02/world-cup-doomsday-scenario-looms-after-socceroos-slip-up-in-oman</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Australia’s 2-2 draw has brought the potential ramifications of missing the tournament in Qatar into sharp focus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Abdullah Fawaz stood over the ball in the 89th minute of the World Cup qualifier between Australia and Oman, it was impossible to ignore the high stakes. His penalty, which he duly deposited beyond Mat Ryan to make it 2-2, were not be enough to keep Oman’s qualification alive, while it placed the Socceroos in a state of existential precariousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being held to a draw at the Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex, Australia’s men now sit in third place in Group B with just two games remaining – on the outside looking in at the two slots that carry automatic qualification for Qatar. Heading into the final slate of games next month, Graham Arnold’s side must defeat the top two –Japan and Saudi Arabia – to hold out any hope of directly punching their tickets, while hoping that other results see goal difference fall in their favour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/02/world-cup-doomsday-scenario-looms-after-socceroos-slip-up-in-oman"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Mohamed Salah makes the difference in Egypt’s fightback victory over Morocco</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/30/egypt-morocco-africa-cup-of-nations-quarter-final-match-report</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A solid defence plus Mohamed Salah equals progress. It might not be particularly edifying or good to watch but it does seem to work. This was a dismal game, two hours of spoiling with a dusting of football but, in the football that was played, Salah was decisive. He scored the equaliser and set up the winner, so Egypt will meet Cameroon in Thursday’s semi-final, a meeting of the two most successful sides in Cup of Nation’s history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egypt had ground their way to this stage, scoring only twice in four games. That’s the way it has always been for Carlos Queiroz and for all the success it has brought him, his cautious strategy can threaten to come unstuck if his side concedes early. Here they were behind inside six minutes, and it would have been earlier but for a weirdly extended VAR check. Ayman Ashraf clearly hacked down Achraf Hakimi and Soufiane Boufal caressed home the penalty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/30/egypt-morocco-africa-cup-of-nations-quarter-final-match-report"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>January window displayed which Premier League clubs have a plan | Fabrizio Romano</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/02/january-transfer-window-displayed-which-premier-league-clubs-have-plan</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Frenetic late transfer activity was marked out with Manchester and Liverpool clubs getting deals done by acting decisively&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt about the most unusual clause of this transfer window. Internazionale signed Robin Gosens on loan from Atalanta with an obligation to buy him for €25m (£20.8m) when they score their first goal of 2023. But perhaps the most interesting theme of the month was what it showed about clubs who have a clear strategy and those who do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a typical January window, with slow weeks followed by a crazy final few days, but whereas some clubs moved late and had real moments of panic, others had an obvious plan. Aston Villa did good business relatively early by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/07/aston-villa-agree-deal-to-sign-philippe-coutinho-on-loan-from-barcelona" title=""&gt;bringing in Philippe Coutinho&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/13/lucas-digne-everton-aston-villa-el-ghazi-transfer-news" title=""&gt;Lucas Digne&lt;/a&gt;, and Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City are also examples of clubs with a policy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/02/january-transfer-window-displayed-which-premier-league-clubs-have-plan"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Transfer window verdict: how every Premier League club fared in January</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/01/january-transfer-window-verdict-how-every-premier-league-club-fared</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Eye-catching signings were made by Liverpool and Aston Villa among others and some sides could pay for a lack of incomings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2022/jan/31/mens-transfer-window-january-2022-all-deals-from-europes-top-five-leagues"&gt;Men’s transfer window– all deals in Europe’s top five leagues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The squad has long been filled out by mediocrity, so on one level the departures of six players who were not regular starters is welcome. But the fact nobody has come in, despite an obvious need up front and an attempt to sign the Juventus-bound Dusan Vlahovic, rings alarm bells and their push for a top-four spot looks a couple of injuries away from derailment. The sanctioning of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s move to Barcelona without his being replaced speaks to Mikel Arteta’s uncompromising principles but also leaves their attacking ranks perilously thin. &lt;strong&gt;Nick Ames&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/01/january-transfer-window-verdict-how-every-premier-league-club-fared"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>African football’s indecisive leaders must accept the blame for Olembe tragedy</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/29/african-footballs-indecisive-leaders-must-accept-the-blame-for-olembe-tragedy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Caf cannot sit above the carnage and casually brush off responsibility nor become Gianni Infantino’s Fifa plaything&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in his first press conference after Monday’s disaster at the Stade Olembé &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/24/africa-cup-of-nations-cameroon-olembe-stadium-crush" title=""&gt;in which eight fans died&lt;/a&gt;, Patrice Motsepe, the president of the Confederation of African Football, was looking to shift the blame. He convened a commission to investigate the causes – it was expected to report on Friday, but is yet to do so – but the avoidance of corporate responsibility had begun already.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was the gate that was “inexplicably” shut. And that, almost certainly, was the direct cause of the buildup of people and the surge towards the open gate that knocked down a temporary barrier and led to people being trampled on. Whoever didn’t open that shut gate will take the blame.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/29/african-footballs-indecisive-leaders-must-accept-the-blame-for-olembe-tragedy"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

Sign up now!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lead-up to Thursday night’s Afcon semi-final between Cameroon and Egypt, a minor exchange of views broke out between Samuel Eto’o and Carlos Queiroz. Eto’o, formerly Cameroon’s star striker and now president of their federation, referred to the upcoming match as a “war”, causing Egypt coach Queiroz to respond philosophically. “Football is not about war,” he insisted. “Football is about celebration, it’s about joy, it’s about happiness.” And so the moment those words left his lips, it instantly became inevitable that Queiroz would spend the duration of the game on a rolling boil, a bain-marie of belligerence whose bellicosity would make Vladimir Putin sound like a member of the Beatles in 1967.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/04/the-fiver-carlos-queiroz-on-a-rolling-boil-egypt-afcon"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Plus: playing for the most Uniteds, a meetings of captains beginning with Z and long waits for second legs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com"&gt;Mail us&lt;/a&gt; your questions or tweet &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/theknowledge_gu"&gt;@TheKnowledge_GU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“As a Blackburn fan I put more stock in 19th century trophies than perhaps I should,”&lt;/strong&gt; writes Simon Elliott. &lt;strong&gt;“However, are Rovers unique in winning major trophies in the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries? Are there any equivalents from other countries? For the purposes of this, the 2002 League Cup is a major trophy.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Though organised football was more or less restricted to these islands in the 19th century there are a number of other clubs who can match or better Blackburn’s achievement,” begins Sean DeLoughry. “Celtic, Rangers, Linfield and Glentoran have won every major domestic competition available to them each century. Additionally, Hibernian, Hearts, Bangor, Distillery and Cliftonville have racked up major honours in each century. Here’s an overview:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;England&lt;/strong&gt;: Blackburn (19th Century Cup, 20th Century League/Cup, 21st Century LC)&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scotland: &lt;/strong&gt;Celtic (19C League/Cup, 20C League/Cup/LC, 21C League/Cup/LC), Hearts (19C League/Cup, 20C League/Cup/LC, 21C Cup), Hibernian (19C Cup, 20C League/Cup/LC, 21C Cup/LC), Rangers (19C League/Cup, 20C League/Cup/LC, 21C League/Cup/LC)&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wales: &lt;/strong&gt;Bangor (19C Cup, 20C League/Cup, 21C League/Cup)&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Northern Ireland&lt;/strong&gt; Cliftonville (19C Cup, 20C League/Cup, 21C League/LC), Distillery (19C League/Cup, 20C League/Cup, 21C LC), Glentoran (19C League/Cup, 20C League/Cup/LC, 21C League/Cup/LC), Linfield (19C League/Cup, 20C League/Cup/LC, 21C League/Cup/LC)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/02/which-football-clubs-have-won-major-trophies-across-three-centuries"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The forgotten story of … Jimmy Hasty, Irish football's one-armed wonder</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/13/the-forgotten-story-of-jimmy-hasty-irish-football-one-armed-wonder</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hasty was one of football’s most remarkable and overlooked players – who then fell victim to a malignant arc of history&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 1960 Jim Malone, the chairman of Dundalk football club, told the board he had discovered an exciting talent, a centre-forward who was scoring goal after goal for Newry Town, just across the border in Northern Ireland. He was tall and strong, had preternatural balance and was lethal in the air. Dundalk should sign him immediately, said Malone. The player’s name was Jimmy Hasty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another board member piped up. He had heard of Hasty, heard something fanciful – that the fellow had only one arm. Malone conceded this was true. Hasty had only one arm. But Dundalk should sign him, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/13/the-forgotten-story-of-jimmy-hasty-irish-football-one-armed-wonder"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Joy of Six: Leeds United v Liverpool Premier League meetings</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/sep/11/the-joy-of-six-leeds-united-v-liverpool-premier-league-meetings</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A look at classics from a Tony Yeboah special in 1995 to a symbolic defeat for David O’Leary in 2002&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s your favourite: Liverpool or Wimbledon? Tony Yeboah won Goal of the Month in August and September 1995 for two screamers, at Elland Road and Selhurst Park, both scorched off the underside of the bar from distance. The Wimbledon goal, a manic, impromptu explosion of brilliance, has greater charisma and was the BBC’s Goal of the Season. But the goal against Liverpool involved a more difficult skill, volleying a ball that was dropping from the heavens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/sep/11/the-joy-of-six-leeds-united-v-liverpool-premier-league-meetings"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Golden Goal: Ronaldo for Internazionale v Lazio (1998) | Daniel Harris</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/nov/10/golden-goal-ronaldo-for-internazionale-v-lazio-1998</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 1998 Uefa Cup final witnessed a goal that was probably the greatest moment of Ronaldo’s greatest game&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up as a football obsessive, by the time I was 17 I thought I’d seen pretty much everything the game had to offer me. You can probably see how I became a sportswriter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around then, I was also spending most weekday evenings hanging about parks, alleyways and pubs to state-alter in one way or another, often under the guise of watching a game. So in the summer of 1996, my parents – who’d spent a decade resisting my pleas to get Teletext – signed up to Sky, sagely rationalising that beaming industrial quantities of sport into our front room would inspire me to take school more seriously.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/nov/10/golden-goal-ronaldo-for-internazionale-v-lazio-1998"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Wycombe’s Matt Bloomfield retires: ‘I forget simple words – it scares me’ | Ben  Fisher</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2022/feb/02/wycombe-matt-bloomfield-retires-i-forget-simple-words-it-scares-me</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A freak concussion – by his estimation a fifth in four years – has ended the Wycombe stalwart’s career and he wants to help others&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Matt Bloomfield staggered off the pitch at Exeter last August he did not know it would be his final game as a professional footballer. Nor did the 191 visiting Wycombe supporters realise a freak blow to the head and concussion would abruptly end a proud playing career after 558 appearances – all but one for their club. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was trying to walk to the tunnel and I kept veering right, towards the away fans, when I was trying to head straight,” Bloomfield recalls. “It is quite a narrow tunnel at Exeter and I was bouncing off the walls to get to the changing room. I was sat in the dressing room and the [club] doctor said I was very agitated and irritable. I couldn’t deal with everything. It all unravelled that evening.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2022/feb/02/wycombe-matt-bloomfield-retires-i-forget-simple-words-it-scares-me"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘The problem was only with Arteta’: Aubameyang back on the up at Barça</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/03/aubameyang-the-problem-was-only-with-arteta-barcelona</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Forward risked his reputation to get a move on deadline day after a difficult two months and now says he is living a dream&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a risk and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang knew it. Arsenal were always going to take a dim view of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/31/barcelona-aubameyang-loan-arsenal"&gt;his trip to Barcelona on Monday morning&lt;/a&gt;, which was where the striker felt he had needed to be. Just in case. To give himself the best opportunity of making it happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not authorised by Arsenal and so there was the possibility of the club fining him although, given the state of his relationship with them and, more specifically, the manager, Mikel Arteta, it had to have felt low down his list of concerns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/03/aubameyang-the-problem-was-only-with-arteta-barcelona"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The football fan who has collected 3,000 shirts from around the world</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/these-football-times/2022/feb/03/football-fan-collection-3000-classic-shirts</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Arjan Wijngaard was given an Everton shirt 25 years ago. His life has not been the same since&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joshisbutler90"&gt;Josh Butler&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://thesefootballtimes.co/"&gt;These Football Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you do when you have nearly 3,000 football shirts in your possession? If you are the Dutch football fan and collector Arjan Wijngaard, you allocate a room in your house as an exhibition space and log every single shirt you buy in &lt;a href="http://www.voetbalshirts.org/"&gt;a comprehensive online catalogue&lt;/a&gt;. Arjan has been collecting shirts from around the globe for the past 25 years, beginning with an Everton kit he was given in 1997, and he now boasts one of the largest, if not the largest, personal collections in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What drew him to the idea of collecting shirts? “Of course, I liked football. That is an important thing if you want to collect shirts. There is no particular reason why I chose shirts, though. Some people choose scarves – I have some scarves as well because, if I can’t get a shirt when I visit a stadium or a game, I try to buy a scarf instead. Actually, maybe I should have chosen scarves or pins; they are a lot cheaper and don’t need that much space!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/these-football-times/2022/feb/03/football-fan-collection-3000-classic-shirts"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Kevin Phillips: ‘I’ve waited a long time to be a manager – I want to do it right’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/28/kevin-phillips-south-shields-manager-interview-sunderland</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;New manager of seventh-tier South Shields on knock-backs, hearing his name sung again and whether he will copy Peter Reid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kevin Phillips starts with a confession. “Before I signed for Sunderland I didn’t even know it was by the sea,” says the new manager of South Shields. “Geography clearly wasn’t my strong point but I ended up enjoying my time in this area so much that, in the back of my mind, I’ve always hoped to come back one day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former England striker’s return to the north-east has brought him to Mariners Park, seven miles up the road from the Stadium of Light and a 10-minute drive from the sandy North Sea beaches where he will doubtless sometimes put his fully professional seventh-tier Northern Premier League Premier Division squad through their paces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/28/kevin-phillips-south-shields-manager-interview-sunderland"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>From Jadon Sancho to Alexander Isak: what happened to Next Generation 2016?</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/oct/05/from-jadon-sancho-to-alexander-isak-what-happened-to-next-generation-2016</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the Next Generation 2021 picks out this week we look at the final updates for the class of 2016. How did they fare?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a time when going abroad wasn’t cool. It was a time when British footballers stayed at home, worried about how they might fare in Europe and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gary Lineker helped to break the mould with his switch – and success – at Barcelona in the 1980s but Ian Rush’s struggles at Juventus around the same time seemed to put off many players.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/oct/05/from-jadon-sancho-to-alexander-isak-what-happened-to-next-generation-2016"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
