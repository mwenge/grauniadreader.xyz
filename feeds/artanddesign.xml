      <title>A rainforest cries: music, art, books and more to help you deal with climate anxiety</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From Noname’s new single to Bruegel’s vision of a lost world, our critics offer up culture for processing the impending crisis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental concerns have motivated the animation giant &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/28/studio-ghibli-ranked-netflix-princess-mononoke-spirited-away"&gt;Studio Ghibli&lt;/a&gt; since its salad days: Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (made pre-Ghibli but now absorbed into its canon) and Pom Poko are among those which imagine climate disaster. The studio reached a peak of cinematic sophistication with &lt;strong&gt;Princess Mononoke&lt;/strong&gt;, Hayao Miyazaki’s 1997 fable about a dying prince drawn into the struggle between nature and civilisation in ancient Japan. Humans battle gods; limbs and heads are severed. Meanwhile, the placid kodama (tree spirits) look on. Their naive, ghostly faces rotate slowly, accompanied by a tick-tick-ticking sound like time running out. &lt;em&gt;Ryan Gilbey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/07/a-rainforest-cries-music-art-books-and-more-to-help-you-deal-with-climate-anxiety"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘I’ve got a love-hate relationship with London’: Jock McFadyen on the city that inspires him</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deserted tube stations and sewage outflow pipes – the work of Paisley-born painter Jock McFadyen captures the eerie emptiness of the city he calls home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jock McFadyen’s London is an eerie place: a derelict sprawl of abandoned buildings, industrial sites and boarded-up shopfronts. His territory is “the edges of the city where it gives away to the landscape”, he says, and paints transitional spaces that are in between uses, or on the way to somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olympia&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(2015) shows the graffiti-covered hoarding of a Hackney building site, with the Olympic Stadium and Anish Kapoor’s Orbit sculpture&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;just visible above; Cambridge Heath&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(2004) depicts an empty petrol station against a tumultuous night sky; Elephant&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(1996) reveals a deserted underground platform, all peeling paint and ominously hanging cables, a no-smoking sign the only hint of habitation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/07/ive-got-a-love-hate-relationship-with-london-jock-mcfadyen-on-the-city-that-inspires-him"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>How the UK’s dutiful launderette is fading under Covid and energy prices</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/07/how-the-uks-dutiful-launderette-is-fading-under-covid-and-energy-prices</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A much-loved community space and an essential service, their days now seem numbered&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing Rajiv Shrikul does when he opens up his launderette in south Edinburgh each morning is pray. He says the 7am routine, which he started as a young boy in India, helps him cope with the kaleidoscope of personalities that pass through his shop. “Some people are angry, some are generous – you need to have a very stable mind. Meditation calms you down, especially in these hard times.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photograph: Murdo MacLeod&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/07/how-the-uks-dutiful-launderette-is-fading-under-covid-and-energy-prices"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Adults are banning books, but they’re not asking our opinions’: meet the teens of the Banned Book Club</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/07/banned-book-club-pennsylvania-animal-farm</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Conservatives are pushing to ban books from school libraries. At a time of crisis, a group of Pennsylvania teenagers are fighting back&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Napoleon’s use of the sheep was notable,” says Jordan Daughtry, 14. She’s clutching a copy of Animal Farm, and referring to the authoritarian Berkshire boar who seizes control of an English acreage, before bending his fellow animals to his will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sheep, who represent the unwitting masses in George Orwell’s critique of Joseph Stalin’s totalitarian rule, are “ignorant buffoons”, Daughtry says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiara Daughtry, left, and Lena Cackley.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/07/banned-book-club-pennsylvania-animal-farm"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Infrared visions of Earth – in pictures</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2022/feb/06/infrared-visions-of-earth-in-pictures</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Photographer and art director &lt;a href="https://paolopettigiani.com/"&gt;Paolo Pettigiani &lt;/a&gt;grew up climbing and hiking in the Italian Alps. Though he now runs a creative agency in Turin, he still wanted to capture his vision of the natural world. “I think colours represent my academic spirit and nature represents my love for outdoor sports.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is &lt;a href="https://www.paolopettigiani.com/infraland"&gt;Infraland&lt;/a&gt;, a series of infrared landscape photos taken with a special camera converted to show the full colour spectrum. “Infrared shows us the invisible world,” he says. “This light sits outside the spectrum the human eye detects. Using it, you show something ordinary in a new way. It makes nature the protagonist of my images.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2022/feb/06/infrared-visions-of-earth-in-pictures"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Van Gogh: Self-Portraits review – ghostly encounters with greatness</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/06/van-gogh-self-portraits-courtauld-gallery-london-review-ghostly-encounters-with-greatness</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Courtauld Gallery, London&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This small, unmissable show of 16 of Van Gogh’s 37 surviving self-portraits, all made during the last four years of his life, reveals a world of extreme feeling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What did Vincent van Gogh look like? Only one photograph of the artist exists, and in it he’s unrecognisable. At 19, the beard has not yet appeared; the familiar inverted triangle of his skull still goes incognito beneath the fleshiness of youth. Later, several of his friends would make portraits of him. But if we know him by his bristles in their pictures, he’s still several kinds of man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toulouse-Lautrec casts him in pastel with the far-off look of the absinthe drinker. In Pissarro’s sketch, in which he sits beside his top-hatted brother, Theo, he is almost (but not quite) the dandy. Gauguin famously has him at his easel, the sunflowers beside him doing nothing whatsoever to ease his mood, which is downcast, shuttered against the world. “It’s me all right, but me gone mad,” he is supposed to have said, on first seeing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/06/van-gogh-self-portraits-courtauld-gallery-london-review-ghostly-encounters-with-greatness"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Tower of Light, Manchester review – a work of fantasy and innovation</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/06/tower-of-light-manchester-review-tonkin-liu-wall-of-energy-a-work-of-fantasy-and-innovation</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by Tudor palaces and one of David Attenborough’s favourite creatures, Tonkin Liu’s flue for Manchester’s new sustainable power system is more than just eye-catching&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manchester has long liked garnishing industry with ornament. For all the four-square practicality of its Victorian streets, its buildings are eclectic in their detail – Byzantine, Flemish, gothic and baroque, encrusted and polychrome, with turrets, domes, gables, swags and cartouches formed from stone, brick and soot-resistant ceramics. Mancunian architecture grew fantasy from the filth of coal-fired wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://tonkinliu.co.uk/tower-of-light"&gt;The Tower of Light&lt;/a&gt;, white and sparkling, updates this tradition for a low-carbon age. It is essentially a big chimney, but not as LS Lowry would have known it. It’s a dispersion flue, to use the technical term, a 40 metre-high device for extracting fumes from a gas-fired combined heat and power unit beneath it. Its swirling forms resemble those that Antoni Gaudí put on top of Barcelona apartment blocks. They are inspired, say its architects &lt;a href="https://tonkinliu.co.uk/who-we-are"&gt;Mike Tonkin and Anna Liu&lt;/a&gt;, both by the ornate chimneys on Tudor palaces and by the glass sponge, a submarine organism that is &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p010nrzh"&gt;one of David Attenborough’s favourite creatures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/06/tower-of-light-manchester-review-tonkin-liu-wall-of-energy-a-work-of-fantasy-and-innovation"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Kaws: New Fiction review – an art show where you brush shoulders with virtual visitors</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/05/kaws-new-fiction-review-brian-donnelly-serpentine-gallery-north-london</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serpentine North Gallery, London&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This hybrid show of physical and digital works by US artist Brian Donnelly – also viewable in the video game Fortnite – could not be more of the moment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, artists have worked across physical and digital canvases, especially in public installations, where a virtual component can lend a futuristic frisson to traditional works. The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/jan/29/huge-mess-of-theft-artists-sound-alarm-theft-nfts-proliferates"&gt;current brouhaha about NFTs&lt;/a&gt; – digital artworks to which proof of ownership can be bought, assigning currently indeterminate rights to the buyer – makes the &lt;a href="https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/whats-on/acute-art-presents-kaws-new-fiction/"&gt;Serpentine Gallery’s New Fiction exhibition&lt;/a&gt; feel especially of the moment, however. The show (admission free) features physical and digital works by Kaws, AKA the Brooklyn-based artist Brian Donnelly, the digital works viewed via a third-party augmented reality app downloaded on to a smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visitors must calibrate the app on arrival; point your phone camera at a QR code outside the gallery and the scene fills with towering, brightly painted figures, including an emaciated Cookie Monster-like character who sits, legs a-dangling, from the plinth above the entrance. Inside, you must again calibrate the app, at which point you wander around the rooms, figuratively brushing shoulders with virtual “visitors” who also form part of the installation. It’s an uncanny feeling seeing virtual characters observe physical works of art (typically, these days, it’s us, the corporeal, who perennially gaze upon the digital), and the sense of discombobulation is compounded by the fact that the exhibit features actual brightly painted bronze statues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/05/kaws-new-fiction-review-brian-donnelly-serpentine-gallery-north-london"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Mike Nelson: The Book of Spells review – a monument to lockdown loneliness</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/03/mike-nelson-the-book-of-spells-review-a-monument-to-lockdown-loneliness</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt’s Gallery, London&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;In a claustrophobic installation, Nelson slams us in the face with the way we’ve been living with this howl of despair from the heart of the pandemic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some lockdown art is inspiring. &lt;a href="https://www.newexhibitions.com/e/58954"&gt;Mike Nelson’s The Book of Spells, (A Speculative Fiction)&lt;/a&gt; is not. Only one person at a time can experience this tiny installation. As the gallerist shuts the door from the outside – was that a key turning? – you are left all alone in a monument to loneliness. The protagonist of this fabulist installation lives in a single room with barely enough space for the iron bed frame on which they apparently spent month after month. A window opens on to a sealed space full of rubble. A child’s forgotten ball sums up the apocalyptic wasteland out there. And in here, the only signs of physical sustenance are a dried squash, an animal bone and a jar of matter that might be seeds or poison. Otherwise the small cupboard is bare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What has the occupant of the room been living on? Dreams of travel. The prison-like bed is surrounded by roughly knocked together wooden bookcases loaded with copies of Rough Guides and Lonely Planets – hundreds of them – plus maps and the occasional &lt;a href="https://www.dk.com/us/"&gt;Dorling Kindersley&lt;/a&gt; volume, the ones that have nice colour pictures of beaches, artworks and local dishes. These are all practical guidebooks, the kind that so many of us stuffed in our hand luggage on the budget flights that made globetrotting so popular up to early 2020.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/03/mike-nelson-the-book-of-spells-review-a-monument-to-lockdown-loneliness"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Magical, mysterious and electrifyingly intimate’ – Van Gogh: Self-Portraits review</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/01/magical-mysterious-electrifyingly-intimate-van-gogh-self-portraits-review-courtauld</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Courtauld, London&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Toothless, bearded, haggard, injured, shaved, well fed, on the mend, jaunty, natty … this superb show cascades through the many faces of Van Gogh – and reveals the anguished brilliance that lay beneath&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the star attractions in the collection of the &lt;a href="https://courtauld.ac.uk/whats-on/van-gogh-self-portraits-22/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA0eOPBhCGARIsAFIwTs5wJRbiAFCWjdesC3ijYBTyVWjpVAGzGIJhqYPsVb_iQRlKG3PXhuUaAmQAEALw_wcB"&gt;Courtauld Gallery&lt;/a&gt; in London is Vincent van Gogh’s Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear, which was painted in January 1889. The artist had mutilated his left ear two days before Christmas, following a quarrel with Paul Gauguin, with whom he had been sharing a house in Arles. Van Gogh looks pale and introspective, clean-shaven, dressed for the winter chill in his yellow room, an easel behind him and a Japanese print on the wall (the Courtauld owns this print, too, but it was stolen in the 1980s and never recovered). The Dutch artist has the hunted look of a man not yet ready to re-enter the world, except through his painting. The open blue door on the right is the same blue door that appears in the picture of his straw-bottomed yellow chair, which now hangs in the same room at the Courtauld. You can take the chair as a kind of self-portrait, too. It is as if he has stepped out for a second, leaving his pipe and tobacco pouch on the seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://courtauld.ac.uk/whats-on/van-gogh-self-portraits-22/"&gt;Van Gogh: Self-Portraits&lt;/a&gt;, the new exhibition at the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/nov/10/courtauld-van-goghs-monets-cezannes-goyas-bruegels-reborn"&gt;recently reopened Courtauld&lt;/a&gt; gallery in London, is filled with presences, absences, substitutions, and echoes of different kinds. It is a magical and at times mysterious show. An exhibition of electrifying intimacy, it shows the artist at his most self-aware and at his most vulnerable. Every painting is both a kind of analysis and a rescue attempt. During the three and a half years before his death in 1890, Van Gogh painted around 35 self-portraits: some may have disappeared or been painted over. Fifteen are here (not counting that chair), as well as a sheet of three graphite, pen and ink drawings. Some are too fragile to travel, others from private collections could not be borrowed. The curators also wished to avoid unnecessary repetition. Some others were considered too clunky or otherwise unsuccessful. As it is, all the above are illustrated in the catalogue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/01/magical-mysterious-electrifyingly-intimate-van-gogh-self-portraits-review-courtauld"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vagina candles nowhere to be seen as Architectural Digest features the actor’s surprisingly cluttered home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowhere to be seen are her company Goop’s own &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jan/13/why-is-gwyneth-paltrow-selling-a-candle-that-smells-like-her-vagina-goop"&gt;vagina candles&lt;/a&gt;, psychic vampire repeller sprays and toothpaste squeezers, and yet Gwyneth Paltrow’s home in Montecito, California is still causing gasps across the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she showed off her palatial house in the March issue of &lt;a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/step-inside-gwyneth-paltrows-tranquil-montecito-home"&gt;Architectural Digest&lt;/a&gt;, many rolled their eyes online at designer Robin Standefer’s claim that it “takes its cues from Gwyneth’s height [and] beauty”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/04/at-home-with-gwyneth-paltrow-3-d-wallpaper-a-spa-and-a-62000-hammock"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘It’s got great drainage!’ – Theaster Gates on his open-to-the-elements Serpentine pavilion</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/03/theaster-gates-serpentine-pavilion</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the kilns of Stoke-on-Trent, the Chicago artist’s Black Chapel will host bands, including his own, and also provide ‘a place of quietude’ where even the British weather is welcome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Serpentine Gallery’s annual summer pavilion will take a spiritual turn this year, in the form of a cylindrical Black Chapel, designed by Chicago-based artist &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/oct/21/theaster-gates-interview-whitechapel-gallery-white-cube"&gt;Theaster Gates&lt;/a&gt;. Taking inspiration from the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/23/thriving-potteries-the-rebirth-of-stoke-on-trent"&gt;kilns of Stoke-on-Trent&lt;/a&gt;, the wooden structure will rise up to a great domed roof, punctured by a central oculus, illuminating a circular space for reflection and musical performances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Coming out of Covid, I thought how nice it would be to have a place of quietude,” said Gates. “It’s a place for people to be with their thoughts and rest, a sacred chapel where you can sit and be reflective. It should give you the ability to touch your inside self.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/03/theaster-gates-serpentine-pavilion"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘A vortex of thinking’ – inside the LSE’s brawny, brainy new building</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/31/vortex-of-thinking-lses-brawny-brainy-new-building-curiosity-shop</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A game of squash, a quick Rachmaninov concert, a brew with a view and then back to studying … the £145m Marshall Building has got the lot, says our writer, even its own Old Curiosity Shop &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One minute, it’s a shish kebab. The next, it’s a washing machine. A second later, it’s a casserole. Speaking to Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara about their new building, the metaphors come tumbling out in a passionate torrent. The two Irish architects, whose practice Grafton &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/03/grafton-architects-win-pritzker-prize"&gt;won worldwide recognition in 2020 when it won the prestigious Pritzker prize&lt;/a&gt;, can’t contain their excitement about their £145m facility for the London School of Economics, partly because they haven’t had a chance to visit it yet. “The pandemic has really made us understand the meaning of longing,” says Farrell. “Site visits on FaceTime just aren’t the same.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The longing is over for students and academics, though, who return to face-to-face teaching this term, in a place that truly brings home the benefits of meeting in the real world. The new &lt;a href="https://info.lse.ac.uk/staff/divisions/estates-division/lse-estate/development-projects/the-marshall-building"&gt;Marshall Building&lt;/a&gt;, which looks out over Lincoln’s Inn Fields like a gleaming white palazzo, houses some of the finest spaces that any London university has to offer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/31/vortex-of-thinking-lses-brawny-brainy-new-building-curiosity-shop"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Laura Cumming’s best art of 2021</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/dec/26/laura-cumming-best-art-of-2021</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The blockbuster battled on, British Caribbean art came home, and from Iran to Nero’s Rome, art transported us far and wide&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/26/mark-kermode-best-films-of-2021"&gt;Mark Kermode’s best films of 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/observer-critics--review-of-2021"&gt;Read the Observer critics’ review of 2021 in full here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the year of the great exhibition – in spite of the plague. Galleries offered online shows when they couldn’t open and riches when they could, no matter the havoc of cancelled loans, insurance hikes and unreliable transport. Schedules were dextrously shifted and blockbusters extended, so judiciously that Tate shows ran longer and the Royal Academy’s magnificent Late Constable continues straight through until next year. Still, one curator confided, 2021 was like playing poker while also juggling eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terrific surveys of female artists continued apace, though still not fast enough to make up for lost time. The wild and stirring genius of the Scottish painter Joan Eardley was celebrated in multiple centenary shows across Scotland. Swiss modernist Sophie Taeuber-Arp’s graphic wit and versatility of needle, pen and paintbrush dazzled at Tate Modern. There were lifetime commemorations of Barbara Hepworth in Wakefield, Eileen Agar at the Whitechapel, Laura Knight at Milton Keynes (&lt;a href="https://mkgallery.org/event/laura-knight/"&gt;still on, until 20 Feb&lt;/a&gt;) and US abstract expressionist Helen Frankenthaler at Dulwich – her visions diaphanous as mist, frequently vast, yet miraculously achieved through hard-line woodcut.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/dec/26/laura-cumming-best-art-of-2021"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cornelie Usborne&lt;/strong&gt; disagrees with Jonathan Jones’s interpretation of Beckmann’s Die Nacht and says the painting is about war, not ‘Weimar excess’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Jones’s choice of Max Beckmann’s painting Die Nacht to illustrate “Weimar excess” was unfortunate (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/31/bootleggers-bondage-and-law-breaking-bashes-the-scandalous-history-of-the-wild-party" title=""&gt;Bootleggers, bondage and law-breaking bashes! The scandalous history of the wild party, 31 January&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far from showing a “party from hell, with bondage, in a room that’s drunkenly shrinking”, it is in fact an allegorical depiction of the tragedy of war and revolution. The viewer is forced to witness the murderous assault on a family hiding in an attic. The fact that the artist depicts his own family renders the tragedy even more poignant: the man with a bandaged head is clearly Beckmann himself; the child abducted by a revolutionary was modelled on his son, Peter; the woman tied and with splayed legs after rape is his wife, Minna. Suffused with Christian imagery, the theme is martyrdom: the strangled man with upturned soles and signs of stigmata recalls Christ’s crucifixion on altar paintings of the old masters Beckmann so much admired.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/04/brush-up-on-the-meaning-of-beckmanns-art"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
