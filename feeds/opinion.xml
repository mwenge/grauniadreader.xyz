      <title>The definition of levelling down: the Bank of England calling for wage ‘restraint’ | Polly Toynbee</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/07/bank-of-england-wage-restraint-cost-of-living-governor</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the midst of a cost-of-living crisis, the Bank’s governor has betrayed a familiar disdain for those struggling to cope&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With just a few words, Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, perfectly crystallised the state and the fate of the nation. Tone-deaf and socially oblivious, the voice booming out from the economic seat of power captured the history of the last lost decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We do need to see restraint in pay bargaining, otherwise it will get out of control,” &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/04/bank-of-england-boss-calls-for-wage-restraint-to-help-control-inflation"&gt;Bailey told the BBC last week&lt;/a&gt;. As wages continue to fall, inflation is set to hit 7.25% in a couple of months, while pay will rise by far less. TUC leaders protest that “workers have been hammered and now they’re coming back for more.” “This is a very tough message to swallow when take-home pay is falling,” the Institute for Fiscal Studies director, Paul Johnson, tells me, pointing to a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/30/tackle-pay-stagnation-to-help-britons-with-soaring-living-costs-urges-tuc"&gt;decade of lost pay&lt;/a&gt; – the longest period of pay stagnation in many years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/07/bank-of-england-wage-restraint-cost-of-living-governor"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Carrie Johnson shouldn’t carry the can for her husband’s mistakes | Gaby Hinsliff</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/07/carrie-johnson-husband-prime-minister</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Blaming the PM’s wife for his political failures obscures the fact that he’s the one who made a vow to the country - not her&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems a lifetime ago now that Camilla Parker Bowles was a scarlet woman, a mistress so reviled some felt she would never be accepted by the public. This week it was announced that she will &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/07/queens-approval-completes-camillas-public-image-turnaround"&gt;become Queen consort&lt;/a&gt; when her husband becomes king, in what felt like the final reward for years of being a Good Wife; the kind who supportively, unselfishly and discreetly enables her husband to become the best version of himself. As an anonymous royal source told the Daily Mail approvingly, Camilla saw her job as doing whatever she was asked to do: “You don’t try to shape the role to your advantage. It’s about duty and service.” And if it’s taken three solid decades of self-effacement to transform her from hate figure to national treasure – well, nobody said being a Good Wife was easy, or indeed fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrie Johnson has certainly found it hard going, judging by a new biography from the Tory peer Lord Ashcroft in which her critics portray her as the wrong kind of wife entirely; too meddlesome, too “woke”, too insistent on her husband changing the odd nappy, and altogether too unlike her predecessor, Marina Wheeler, who made his life run so smoothly that he didn’t have to worry about anything (and was duly rewarded for her efforts by being repeatedly cheated on). Poor Boris needs “mothering”, we’re told, not someone nagging him about net zero. Setting aside the fact that portraying the prime minister as a needy manchild does him no favours, the trouble with this reductive nonsense is that as an explanation for his current misfortunes, it simply doesn’t wash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/07/carrie-johnson-husband-prime-minister"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Wasteful, costly and cruel: it’s time to bin GCSEs for good | Simon Jenkins</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/07/gcse-exams-pandemic-education-system</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The pandemic gave us the chance to rethink our education system, so why do we persist with this pointless ritual?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I prayed that the government might make permanent the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-uk-schools-to-be-closed-indefinitely-and-exams-cancelled"&gt;cancelling of GCSE exams&lt;/a&gt; because of Covid. This wasteful, costly, cruel and pointless ritual of teenage evaluation could at last be binned; schools could revert from being testing machines to actually educating children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No such luck. This week, thousands of young people will start their “mocks”, driving through to exams beginning in May, then results in August to prepare for further examination at A-level. For some, half a year will have been spent being measured. Ever since Michael Gove abolished &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-22841266"&gt;continuous teacher assessment&lt;/a&gt;, the exam hall has become the high temple – or torture chamber – of schooling, the great God of metrics rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/07/gcse-exams-pandemic-education-system"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Politicians may have forgotten about ‘community’, but British people haven’t | Julian Coman</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/07/politicians-community-british-people-tory-labour</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the Tory party reverts to type, Labour should draw on its own rich heritage to do the job of ‘renewing common life’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a short period in the 1990s, it seemed that Labour would launch a communitarian counter-revolution to bring the curtain down on the Thatcher era. Listen to a youthful Tony Blair in 1996, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-923X.00456"&gt;addressing the Women’s Institute&lt;/a&gt;: “At the heart of my beliefs is the idea of community,” said Blair. “I don’t just mean the villages, towns and cities in which we live. I mean that our fulfilment as individuals lies &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/jun/08/uk.labour2"&gt;in a decent society of others&lt;/a&gt;. My argument to you today is that the renewal of community is the answer to the challenges of a changing world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That zeal for a politics which challenged the individualism of the age did not last. As the Labour MP Jon Cruddas ruefully noted in his recent book, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/apr/11/jon-cruddas-dignity-of-labour-meritocratic-elite-interview"&gt;The Dignity of Labour&lt;/a&gt;, in power Blair and his party swerved off in a different direction. Choice, individual aspiration and the imperative to adapt to the consequences of globalisation became New Labour’s guiding themes. The party lost its focus when it came to protecting the self-esteem and interests of places in its post-industrial heartlands, although it did its best to keep many of them financially afloat. Disillusionment and a sense of anomie grew, paving the way for the red wall Brexit vote in 2016. Damaging divisions – cultural as well as economic – emerged between more prosperous, younger cities and declining, ageing towns; between the highly educated and those without a degree, and between an asset-rich generation and those who would never own their own homes. Faith in a social contract that bound the nation together – and in Labour’s ability to secure it – faded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julian Coman is a Guardian associate editor&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/07/politicians-community-british-people-tory-labour"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>This government has been built on a fantasy. Restoring reality will cost the Tories dear | Nesrine Malik</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/07/government-fantasy-reality-tories-boris-johnson-lies-conservative</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Boris Johnson’s lies have damaged democracy - but it’s the entire Conservative ecosystem that has let him get away with it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a literary and cinematic device that usually signals the protagonist has entered a world that may look normal but is in fact slightly off. A clock might start moving backwards; a ball might be thrown in the air and keep rising, disappearing into the sky. The main character in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jul/10/film-review-inception-christopher-nolan"&gt;Christopher Nolan’s Inception&lt;/a&gt;, for example, moves between reality and complex dream worlds. When he can no longer tell the difference between the two, he uses a small silver spinning top as a reality check. If it loses momentum and stops spinning, he is awake. If it continues to spin, he is asleep, lost in an uncontrollable nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since news of No 10’s parties started being leaked to the press, many of us have become that anxious man, desperately waiting for the spinning top to slow down and topple over: for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/06/boris-johnson-on-the-brink-the-week-that-led-his-premiership-to-unravel"&gt;Boris Johnson to resign&lt;/a&gt;; for his party to finally boot him out; for some sign that we are not living in a world where the rules no longer apply. Every time speculation about the 54 letters required to trigger a no-confidence vote has intensified, or a senior Tory has broken cover and condemned Johnson, or a report has confirmed partying during lockdown and “failures of leadership”, the spinning top has slowed, as it has seemed certain that not another day could pass with Johnson still in office.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/07/government-fantasy-reality-tories-boris-johnson-lies-conservative"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Tories’ ‘tough on crime’ stance has only led to misery and death in prisons | Frances Ryan</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/07/tories-tough-on-crime-death-prisons</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;More prisoners are dying in England and Wales than ever – but the government is too busy posturing to do anything about it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a man currently under investigation by the police, Boris Johnson has quite the interest in law and order. Throughout his premiership,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the government has used the rhetoric of being “tough on crime” as a pillar of its populist appeal, epitomised by the home secretary, Priti Patel, turning up to a photo-op last year &lt;a href="https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/brexit-news-westminster-news-priti-patel-jacket-home-secretary-7995286/"&gt;in a personalised police vest&lt;/a&gt;. This would be nauseating at the best of times, but when combined with their &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/18/curbs-on-noisy-protests-may-return-to-commons-after-lords-defeat"&gt;attempts to curb protest&lt;/a&gt;, it has deeply worrying authoritarian undertones. This stance also means the government has little interest in the nuts and bolts of running a humane&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;prison system – which has led to the borderline neglect of the men, women and children who are currently incarcerated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been painfully brought to the fore by new figures from the Ministry of Justice which show that the number of people dying behind bars in England and Wales &lt;a href="https://howardleague.org/news/death-toll-in-prisons-in-england-and-wales-rises-to-highest-level-since-current-recording-practices-began/"&gt;has reached its highest level&lt;/a&gt; since current recording practices began. Some 371 people died in prison custody in 2021 – the equivalent of more than one a day. Many of these deaths were coronavirus-related. Tragically, 86 took their own lives, up from 67 the previous year. We may no longer have the death penalty in this country, but people in prison are still dying under the state’s watch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/07/tories-tough-on-crime-death-prisons"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Caught in the rental trap, we’re trying to turn our flat into a co-op. Here’s what we’ve learned | Ruby Lott-Lavigna</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/07/rental-trap-flat-co-op-homeownership-housing-crisis</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This kind of homeownership is a sustainable solution to the housing crisis – but it’s not easy in today’s property market &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My home, like many people’s, is a place of solace and comfort. It’s somewhere I’ve worked through the end of a long-term relationship, hosted parties, waged an ongoing war with a squirrel in my garden and housed my extensive&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;condiment collection. Despite my emotional ties to this place, I do not own it. Like the other &lt;a href="https://www.generationrent.org/about_renting#:~:text=13%20million%20people%20in%20the,in%20every%205%20of%20us."&gt;13 million&lt;/a&gt; people in the UK who rent from private landlords, that puts me in a permanently precarious situation. I am at the behest of a landlord, who can evict me for no reason, at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this state of uncertainty, you can be reminded of your powerlessness at any moment. That moment came for me and my housemates towards the end of last year, when we found out that our landlords were considering selling. So what did three young professionals with no rich benefactors but an unusually large understanding of housing policy do? We decided to try to turn our house into a cooperative.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/07/rental-trap-flat-co-op-homeownership-housing-crisis"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Britain’s Covid story is about sacrifice and selflessness. Boris Johnson can’t tell it  | John Harris</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/britain-covid-story-boris-johnson-prime-minister</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The prime minister’s crumbling authority has created a vacuum, and the right is already filling it with dangerous narratives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2021, the American magazine the Atlantic ran a &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/07/boris-johnson-minister-of-chaos/619010/"&gt;long and admiring profile&lt;/a&gt; of Boris Johnson. “To him,” wrote the author, “the point of politics – and life – is not to squabble over facts; it’s to offer people a story they can believe in.” Johnson himself made the same point, in rather more elegant language: “People live by narrative. Human beings are creatures of the imagination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back then, those words were intended to capture Johnson’s talent for an unorthodox kind of political communication, and explain his success. But in early 2022 they sound more like an encapsulation of the reasons for his inevitable demise. The simple tale of the people who made the rules arrogantly breaking them is now immeasurably more powerful than any of the narratives he offers in his defence. To say that people tell stories, moreover, is often to associate them with lies, and so it has proved. Johnson’s evasions and untruths now extend into the distance; what he repeatedly – &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/02/why-is-boris-johnson-making-false-claims-about-starmer-and-savile"&gt;and desperately&lt;/a&gt; – said about Keir Starmer and Jimmy Savile is only the latest example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Harris is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/britain-covid-story-boris-johnson-prime-minister"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Hello Dubai: the new crop of reality shows offering a route out of Britain | Kitty Drake</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/dubai-reality-shows-britain</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Programmers are capitalising on the UK’s bleak reality with shows that seem to promise a glamorous life abroad &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thrill of reality TV has always been its escapism. Lately, though, I have been gobbling up a new crop of BBC reality shows, such as Ibiza Dreams and Inside Dubai: Playground of the Rich, which seem less about escapism than offering British people an exit plan. A similar story will become the basis for the upcoming BBC show Dubai Hustle, in which 20-something Britons compete to sell Dubai real estate. The contestants’ desperation to escape the UK’s “bleak employment prospects” – as the programme’s promotional material puts it – is being deployed to raise the TV stakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dream these shows are selling is expatriation: to physically escape (preferably for ever) the UK. Dubbed “aspirational” within the TV industry, the programmes follow UK citizens who swap underpaid jobs in British supermarkets and call centres to pursue glamorous careers in places such as Dubai and Ibiza. In Inside Dubai, the BBC makes no mention of the city state’s &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/26485057.pdf?ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_SYC-5187_SYC-5188%2Fcontrol&amp;amp;refreqid=fastly-default%3A2453a659658dc844da36c505c2c40235"&gt;well-documented use of slave labour&lt;/a&gt;, preferring to paint it as an Oz-like land of milk and honey – a place where you can hire a servant, or drink a cappuccino decorated with a foamy picture of your own face. A place where, if you are a clever expat, you can make tax-free millions doing strange and wonderful things such as selling truffles, or organising birthday parties for dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kitty Drake is a writer and editor based in London&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/dubai-reality-shows-britain"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>For the first time in its history, Facebook is in decline. Has the tech giant begun to crumble? | John Naughton</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/first-time-history-facebook-decline-has-tech-giant-begun-crumble</link>
      <description>As long as the number of users kept growing, Mark Zuckerberg felt able to ride out scandals and criticism. He can no longer rely on that defence&lt;p&gt;Facebook was much &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/03/facebook-stock-shares-meta-mark-zuckerberg" title=""&gt;in the news&lt;/a&gt; last week, although you may not realise that because it has been renamed Meta in the hope the bad vibes associated with its maiden name would gradually fade from public memory. (Google tried the same stunt with Alphabet and that hasn’t worked either.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a change, though, Facebook’s latest moment at the top of the news agenda had nothing to do with scandals and everything to do with its financial results, which were so unexpectedly bad that the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/03/why-facebook-shares-are-in-freefall-meta-zuckerberg" title=""&gt;shares dropped 25%&lt;/a&gt; at one point, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/51ea47e1-50c1-4b72-94d6-884017a1af4a" title=""&gt;taking $240bn&lt;/a&gt; (£177bn) off its market value, which in turn led to a 2% drop in the Nasdaq index.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/first-time-history-facebook-decline-has-tech-giant-begun-crumble"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Boris Johnson’s claim that he is capable of change is just his latest falsehood | Andrew Rawnsley</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/boris-johnson-claim-that-he-is-capable-of-change-is-just-his-latest-falsehood</link>
      <description>Purging the staff at Number Ten won’t make any difference while he remains there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a serially unfaithful husband pleading with his much-betrayed wife for one last chance – a speech he’s had plenty of practice at – Boris Johnson is telling anyone prepared to listen that he can change. Don’t kick me out of the house, so he begs Tory MPs with their fingers on the trigger of a confidence vote, I will prove to you that I can be a different man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did the same after the release of Sue Gray’s heavily circumscribed, and yet still highly damning, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-60201752" title=""&gt;preliminary report&lt;/a&gt; about the orgy of lockdown-busting booze-ups at Number 10. Unable to quarrel with her conclusion that there were “failures of leadership and judgment”, the prime minister &lt;a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2022-01-31/debates/6B412B49-AB7D-4FE3-9F82-B9EAE93FB6AC/SueGrayReport" title=""&gt;told the Commons&lt;/a&gt;: “I get it and I will fix it.” No, he doesn’t. No, he won’t. Even if this sly old leopard sincerely wanted to change his spots, he is incapable of it. The Conservative MPs who are invited to meetings with him hear faux-earnest pledges that he will pay more attention to their views in future and assemble a more professional team at Number 10. Only the hopelessly credulous will believe this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/boris-johnson-claim-that-he-is-capable-of-change-is-just-his-latest-falsehood"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Question Time showed that you can’t counter anti-vax myths with cold reason alone | Sonia Sodha</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/instead-of-debunking-anti-vax-myths-question-time-gave-them-platform</link>
      <description>Changing minds is more complicated than simply exposing poor arguments&lt;p&gt;How do you react when someone politely but firmly tells you that you’re talking nonsense about something that’s important to you? Do you gracefully and immediately give way to their greater expertise? Or do you double down?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us are in the latter camp. Voicing our beliefs tends to solidify them. We may like to think of ourselves as rational creatures, constantly assessing the world for new information that might change our minds, but this is not how our brains work. Explaining to someone that their belief is flat-out wrong is not a good way of getting them to drop it. And &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/295478583_Making_The_Truth_Stick_and_The_Myths_Fade_Lessons_from_Cognitive_Psychology" title=""&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; that the process of “myth-busting” – setting out a common false statement, then explaining why it is wrong – backfires because it counterintuitively reinforces and helps spread the myths.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/instead-of-debunking-anti-vax-myths-question-time-gave-them-platform"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Sure, let’s be wary of abuse of power, but do we really want to outlaw office romance? | Stephanie Merritt</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/little-can-top-the-frisson-of-an-office-romance-so-lets-not-rush-to-outlaw-them</link>
      <description>The president of CNN has resigned because of a relationship with a colleague. It’s hard to see this as progress&lt;p&gt;The news that one more prominent man in the world of media has been forced to resign over a sex scandal barely warrants the raise of an eyebrow these days, but it is noteworthy if he resigns because there was sex with no scandal. This was the case for Jeff Zucker, now ex-president of CNN, who &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/02/jeff-zucker-resigns-cnn-relationship-senior-executive" title=""&gt;stepped down&lt;/a&gt; last week after it was revealed that he was romantically involved with a colleague, Allison Gollust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Zucker’s resignation has prompted speculation about political machinations behind the scenes, it’s hard to see what he actually did wrong. The relationship was consensual; both Zucker and Gollust are divorced and of a similar age (he’s 56, she’s 49). By Zucker’s own admission, his fault was the failure to disclose the relationship when it began, in line with company policy. Much as it pains me to agree with the &lt;em&gt;HBO Real Time&lt;/em&gt; host Bill Maher, he had a point when &lt;a href="https://hollywood-elsewhere.com/author/gruver56/" title=""&gt;he remarked&lt;/a&gt;: “This used to be called discretion.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/little-can-top-the-frisson-of-an-office-romance-so-lets-not-rush-to-outlaw-them"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>We can’t let China use the Olympics to mask genocide and human rights abuses | David Lammy</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/we-cant-let-china-use-olympics-mask-genocide-human-rights-abuses</link>
      <description>As the Games get under way, Britain must stand by the values embodied in Team GB and send a clear message to Beijing&lt;p&gt;China should not have been given the honour of hosting this year’s Winter Olympics. When Beijing hosted the summer Games in 2008, the prevailing hope was that engagement with China would lead to greater openness. Such views now look naive. Instead, the opposite has happened: while China’s economy has boomed, the last decade has seen a concerted crackdown on human rights, a centralisation of political power and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/24/should-athletes-be-worried-about-flaws-in-chinas-olympics-app" title=""&gt;creeping and extensive surveillance&lt;/a&gt;, as athletes and officials are now discovering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This growing authoritarianism has reached new and sinister heights under President Xi Jinping, including the dismantling of Hong Kong’s democracy. Most horrific is the situation in Xinjiang, where there is extensive evidence of mass “re-education” camps, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/18/clues-to-scale-of-xinjiang-labour-operation-emerge-as-china-defends-camps" title=""&gt;forced labour&lt;/a&gt;, forced sterilisation and cultural repression on an industrial scale against the Uyghur people. The appalling treatment of the Uyghurs has led our parliament and others around the world to recognise that China’s actions &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/09/uyghurs-subjected-to-genocide-by-china-unofficial-uk-tribunal-finds" title=""&gt;amount to genocide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/we-cant-let-china-use-olympics-mask-genocide-human-rights-abuses"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Guardian view on Amnesty’s Israel report: dominating the discourse | Editorial</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/the-guardian-view-on-amnestys-israel-report-dominating-the-discourse</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The continuing subjugation of Palestinians erodes the country’s stature internationally and damages its democracy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ehud Barak, Israel’s then defence minister and the country’s most decorated soldier, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/03/barak-apartheid-palestine-peace" title=""&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; in 2010 that “as long as in this territory west of the Jordan river there is only one political entity called Israel, it is going to be either non-Jewish or non-democratic. If this bloc of millions of Palestinians cannot vote, that will be an apartheid state.” This argument &lt;a href="https://forward.com/news/468379/timeline-term-apartheid-israel/" title=""&gt;was made again in 2014 by John Kerry&lt;/a&gt; as US secretary of state (though he later regretted the language). Three years later, Boris Johnson, when he was UK foreign secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/it-s-a-two-state-solution-or-apartheid-boris-tells-israel-53bmmcjtv" title=""&gt;said much the same thing&lt;/a&gt;. No one seemed in any doubt that were Israel to carry on without making peace with the Palestinians, the country would face &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/05/amnesty-israel-apartheid-israeli-politicians-agree" title=""&gt;credible accusations of apartheid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a four-year investigation, &lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/resources/EndIsraelsApartheid" title=""&gt;Amnesty last week&lt;/a&gt; became the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/17/the-guardian-view-on-israel-and-apartheid-prophecy-or-description" title=""&gt;latest human rights organisation&lt;/a&gt; to level that charge, concluding that Israel operated a “system which amounts to apartheid under international law”. It said that the UN security council must “impose targeted sanctions against Israeli officials implicated”, and demanded an arms embargo on Israel. Amnesty also called for the perpetrators of apartheid to be “brought to justice” through the international criminal court. This is the world’s biggest human rights organisation; its conclusion shows the discussion is becoming embedded in international forums.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/the-guardian-view-on-amnestys-israel-report-dominating-the-discourse"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Guardian view on sick pay: a system unfit for purpose | Editorial</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/the-guardian-view-on-sick-pay-a-system-unfit-for-purpose</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fixing the UK’s broken sick pay regime would reduce the spread of infectious diseases – and be a small step towards a fairer country&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sajid Javid has begun a rather dramatic U-turn. Until recently, the health secretary insisted that care workers and frontline NHS staff had to get vaccinated against Covid or find another post, but the policy has now been dropped. Compulsory vaccination is still good health policy, he told fellow MPs, but ministers worry about a plunge in staff numbers. Yet there is a policy that public health officials, doctors and trade unionists have been calling for since the start of the pandemic, and that would not infringe on civil liberties or dent staff numbers: introducing a proper sick pay system. Doing that would reduce the spread of infectious diseases, ease the cost-of-living crisis for the working poor during this pandemic, and be a small step towards a fairer country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK’s statutory sick pay system is in terrible health. The previous health secretary, Matt Hancock, &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-uk-statutory-sick-pay-matt-hancock-question-time-covid-19-a9413821.html" title=""&gt;admitted&lt;/a&gt; that he couldn’t live on what it pays, currently £96.35 a week. No surprise there: it is &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/paid-sick-leave-to-protect-income-health-and-jobs-through-the-covid-19-crisis-a9e1a154/#figure-d1e652" title=""&gt;among the lowest sick pay in the industrialised world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/the-guardian-view-on-sick-pay-a-system-unfit-for-purpose"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Observer view on the forthcoming French elections  | Observer editorial</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/observer-view-on-forthcoming-french-elections</link>
      <description>With seven leftwing Élysée hopefuls in the running, next time the left might win over voters by shunning factionalism&lt;p&gt;France’s presidential election is still two months away and the most likely winner, according to opinion polls, the incumbent, Emmanuel Macron, has yet to declare his candidacy. Yet one result already appears certain: the vote will be another, perhaps terminal, disaster for the once-dominant Socialist party and, more broadly, the &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2022/2/4/the-french-left-the-presidential-race-and-the" title=""&gt;French left&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Important lessons may be drawn from this impending failure by other European progressive, social democratic parties and also by Labour in Britain. The re-election victory in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/31/portugal-general-election-pm-antonio-costa-wins-surprise-outright-majority" title=""&gt;Portugal&lt;/a&gt; last week of António Costa’s Socialists, who improved on their 2019 performance, demonstrated it is still possible for the centre-left to win, govern and win again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/observer-view-on-forthcoming-french-elections"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Observer view on Britain’s growing cost of living crisis | Observer editorial</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/observer-view-on-britain-cost-of-living-crisis</link>
      <description>While the Tories feud over Boris Johnson, the country edges deeper into an economic mire that will cause hardship for thousands&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England last week published a set of grim economic forecasts that project inflation will peak at over 7% this year and real household incomes will fall by an average of £1,000 by the &lt;a href="https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/the-price-is-right/" title=""&gt;end of 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the energy price cap will have risen by hundreds of pounds over the same period. Without another Covid wave, it is the cost of living crisis and particularly its impact on families already struggling to meet their rent, put food on the table and pay their heating bills that will dominate people’s lives in the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Boris Johnson remains mired in the depths of political crisis, debilitated in his role as prime minister, while his potential successors are more concerned with their campaigns to succeed him than addressing the challenges faced by the country. Westminster politics reached a new nadir when, in order to try to shift focus from his own woes, he falsely accused Keir Starmer of failing to prosecute the child abuser Jimmy Savile, a &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/60213975" title=""&gt;made-up allegation&lt;/a&gt; with no grounds in reality. Savile’s victims have &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/jimmy-saviles-victims-call-on-boris-johnson-to-withdraw-sir-keir-starmer-accusations-12530517" title=""&gt;spoken out&lt;/a&gt; about their distress at seeing their abuse politicised by the prime minister in this way and the unfounded slur prompted the resignation of his long-serving policy chief, Munira Mirza, who accused him of “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/03/boris-johnsons-policy-chief-quits-over-pms-scurrilous-savile-remark" title=""&gt;scurrilous&lt;/a&gt;” behaviour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/observer-view-on-britain-cost-of-living-crisis"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Britain’s failure to tackle Russian dirty money has enabled Putin’s aggression | Nicola Sturgeon</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/01/ukraine-russia-vladimir-putin-boris-johnson-dirty-money</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If Boris Johnson is serious about helping Ukraine, the most resolute action he can take is at home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prospect of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/30/ukraine-putin-russia-phoney-war-surreal-theatre"&gt;war in our continent&lt;/a&gt; is more than enough to avert our gaze from the latest Whitehall troubles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a prime minister who has found it so hard to speak the truth throughout his career surprised us all with a hard dose of it when he stood before parliament last week to address the situation in Ukraine, saying: “Ukraine asks for nothing except to be allowed to live in peace and to seek her own alliances, as every sovereign country has a right to do.” It was a sentiment echoed by the leader of the opposition, by my own party’s Westminster group leader, Ian Blackford MP, and by every other SNP MP who responded to the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicola Sturgeon is first minister of Scotland and leader of the Scottish National party&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/01/ukraine-russia-vladimir-putin-boris-johnson-dirty-money"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Mandatory vaccination for health workers was a bad idea, but a U-turn could be worse | Stephen Reicher</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/01/all-uk-health-workers-vaccinated-building-trust-mandate-u-turn</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;People who were planning to have the vaccine may conclude it is no longer necessary to do so&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you get health workers to do something as personally intimate and publicly important as getting vaccinated? The government’s response was, until this week, “get vaccinated or get out”. Those in the know have long disagreed with this. The British Medical Association is strongly in favour of vaccines&lt;a href="https://www.bma.org.uk/advice-and-support/covid-19/vaccines/covid-19-mandatory-vaccine-guidance"&gt; and encourages all its members to get the jab&lt;/a&gt; – but it admits that “mandating Covid-19 vaccination raises a number of complicated ethical and practical issues”. The Royal College of Nursing strongly recommends that “&lt;a href="https://www.rcn.org.uk/get-help/rcn-advice/covid-19-and-mandatory-vaccination"&gt;all members are vaccinated as soon as they can be&lt;/a&gt;” – but is also clear that making the vaccine compulsory could undermine its uptake, and “significantly impact on the retention of staff”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the BMA and the RCN made their stances clear to the government as early as last September. But ministers did not listen. In December, the RCN once more expressed its concerns and called on the government to delay the vaccine mandate. The government ignored it again – until now, when, with a staffing disaster approaching, ministers have been forced to acknowledge the facts and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/31/covid-mandatory-jabs-nhs-staff-england-omicron-u-turn"&gt;back off from compulsory vaccination&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen Reicher is a member of the Sage subcommittee advising on behavioural science. He is a professor of psychology at the University of St Andrews, a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and an authority on crowd psychology&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/01/all-uk-health-workers-vaccinated-building-trust-mandate-u-turn"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Covid has been an easy scapegoat for economic disruption, but Brexit is biting | Anand Menon</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/31/covid-easy-scapegoat-economic-disruption-brexit-biting</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the pandemic recedes, the negative impacts of Brexit will become clearer and its political effects more unpredictable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anand Menon is director of the UK in a Changing Europe &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s two years since the UK left the European Union, slightly more than one since it exited the single market and customs union. Yet, as one prominent Brexit supporter has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/darrengrimes_/status/1473294722034716692?s=11"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, no one seems to have starved to death. A low bar, admittedly, but one takes what one can in these pandemic-ravaged times. However, while we may still have food on the shelves, Brexit has already begun to act as a drag on the UK economy. It seems clear this will persist, though it’s less clear as to what implications this will have for the ongoing Brexit debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think back to the febrile atmosphere of the referendum and its aftermath. There was plenty of loose talk on all sides. Claims such as the £350m on the bus or George Osborne’s warning of the need for an emergency budget in the event of a vote to leave were generally overblown. And remainer rhetoric provided an opening for Brexiters. In response to 2017 warnings about a Brexit “cliff edge”, a spokesperson for the Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-39405561"&gt;remarked acidly&lt;/a&gt; that “according to project fear we should be holed up in a post-apocalyptic wasteland in threadbare clothes eating tinned food by now”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anand Menon is director of the UK in a Changing Europe and professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King’s College London&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/31/covid-easy-scapegoat-economic-disruption-brexit-biting"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Why it’s the right time to lift plan B restrictions in England | Raghib Ali</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/28/lift-plan-b-restrictions-england-vaccines-restrictions</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the vaccines, we no longer need harsh restrictions – but we should still act with caution and consideration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been two months since the first cases of Omicron were identified in the UK. In the weeks after it emerged, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/16/omicron-covid-variant-uk-key-questions"&gt;modelling scenarios&lt;/a&gt; presented to Sage suggested we were facing a situation even worse than last winter, with potentially tens of thousands of hospital admissions and thousands of deaths a day. Thankfully, as we now know, these scenarios did not materialise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbers of admissions and deaths peaked below the level expected in even the best-case scenarios. Pressure on hospitals remained very high, but in most cases, the situation was better than feared. The editor of the Lancet, Richard Horton, this week described scientists’ response to Omicron as “&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)00093-9/fulltext"&gt;a case study in error&lt;/a&gt;”. He attributed this to an “over-reliance on mathematical modelling and too little emphasis on the experience of health workers on the frontlines of care”, with insufficient attention paid to the views of South African doctors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/28/lift-plan-b-restrictions-england-vaccines-restrictions"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Why mathematicians sometimes get Covid projections wrong | Kit Yates</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/26/mathematicians-covid-projections-modelling</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Modelling may not be a crystal ball, but it remains the best tool we have to predict the future&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Official modelling efforts have been subjected to barrages of criticism throughout the pandemic, from across the political spectrum. No doubt some of that criticism has appeared justified – the result of highly publicised projections that never came to pass. In July 2021, for instance, the newly installed health secretary, Sajid Javid, warned that cases could &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/06/covid-cases-rise-above-100000-a-day-sajid-javid-concedes-england"&gt;soon rise above 100,000 a day&lt;/a&gt;. His figure was based on modelling from the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, known as SPI-M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One influential SPI-M member, Prof Neil Ferguson, went further and suggested that, following the “freedom day” relaxation of restrictions on 19 July, the 100,000 figure was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/18/uk-covid-cases-could-hit-200000-a-day-says-neil-ferguson-scientist-behind-lockdown-strategy-england"&gt;“almost inevitable”&lt;/a&gt; and that 200,000 cases a day was possible. Cases topped out at an average of about &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases"&gt;50,000 a day&lt;/a&gt; just before “freedom day”, before falling and plateauing between 25,000 and 45,000 for the next four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kit Yates is director of the Centre for Mathematical Biology at the University of Bath and author of The Maths of Life and Death&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/26/mathematicians-covid-projections-modelling"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>In future, living with Covid could mean boosters only for our most vulnerable | Andrew Pollard</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/25/vaccines-best-weapon-covid-boosters</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Making vaccines available to all is crucial. But for most of us, multiple top-ups won’t be necessary &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest"&gt;Coronavirus – latest updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak"&gt;See all our coronavirus coverage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the pandemic began almost two years ago, the monster that is Covid-19 has visited every corner of Earth, killing more than 5.5 million people. But we have fought back with astounding speed and vigour, and the situation today is very different from that in early 2020. Ten billion vaccine doses will have been administered worldwide &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations"&gt;by early February&lt;/a&gt;. The Covax scheme &lt;a href="https://www.cityam.com/covax-scheme-hits-1bn-vaccine-deliveries-despite-supply-chain-struggles/"&gt;has delivered 1bn vaccines&lt;/a&gt; to lower-income countries. As a result, global daily deaths from the virus are&lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;at their &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer"&gt;lowest point in more than a year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, is the monster slain? No. Covid-19 will not just disappear. Only one human infectious disease has been eradicated from the planet – smallpox – and that took nearly 200 years. Polio is near to extinction, but it has taken a 70-year campaign. Covid-19 may be even more troublesome. Unlike those viruses, Covid-19 has been able to easily adapt to find its way around human immunity (whether from infection or vaccination) so that it can survive.

      <title>Reaching for military metaphors won’t help Britain learn to live with Covid | Philip Ball</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/24/britain-covid-how-pandemics-end</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There will be no ‘victory’ or ‘armistice day’ – the reality of how pandemics end is far more complicated than that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Covid pandemic has entered a perplexing phase, challenging our beliefs about what the best responses are and how we should behave. Is Omicron now “just like the flu”, meaning we can relax – or does that overlook the continuing crisis in hospitals, the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/28be9d3f-0b12-4c33-bda9-fbff375c0b7e"&gt;record hospitalisation rates&lt;/a&gt; for children, the continuing deadly danger for elderly and clinically vulnerable people, and the lengthening shadow of long Covid? Is it time, as the government has decided in England, to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/20/covid-england-mask-boris-johnson-omicron"&gt;throw away our masks&lt;/a&gt; and perhaps to abandon self-isolation rules, or is that recklessly optimistic (if not just politically expedient for the prime minister)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our pandemic narratives are splintering. Once, aside from a handful of noisy libertarians who insisted that lockdowns and mask mandates were violations of civil liberty, most people accepted that restrictions were necessary to prevent the health system from imploding and to reduce the risks for vulnerable people. Now, even some experts who previously advised caution and criticised lax and tardy government strategy,&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/19/science-covid-ineradicable-disease-prevention"&gt; such as the public health expert Devi Sridhar of Edinburgh University&lt;/a&gt;, have suggested that the virus has been largely “defanged” and that it’s time to “move forward” with our lives. Others react to such suggestions with horror, pointing out that this isn’t an option open to all. There’s much talk of the virus having become &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/05/covid-19-from-pandemic-to-endemic-this-is-how-we-might-get-back-to-normal"&gt;“endemic”&lt;/a&gt; – but that notion of a “persistent, low or moderate level of disease”, generally in a specific geographical region, is a long way from the exponential rise, and now fall, that we have just seen nationwide. It’s likely that it’s where we’ll end up eventually. But the eagerness to reach for the term now reflects an increasing sense that, one way or another, we will have to learn to live with the virus, as the health secretary, Sajid Javid, said last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philip Ball is a science writer. His books include &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/24/water-kingdom-secret-history-china-philip-ball-review"&gt;The Water Kingdom: A Secret History of China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/24/britain-covid-how-pandemics-end"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The HIV epidemic wasn’t curbed by data alone – and Covid won’t be either | João Florêncio</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/21/hiv-epidemic-data-covid-public-health-messaging</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s we learned that public health messaging divorced from people’s values simply doesn’t work &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of the pandemic, communication from the government, epidemiologists and health statisticians appears to rely on the belief that if people are shown enough graphs, enough models, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/21/deep-within-the-uks-shocking-covid-data-there-may-be-reasons-for-optimism"&gt;enough statistics&lt;/a&gt;, enough information, they will all act rationally and do the right thing. Even when that is deeply at odds with the way people live: closing oneself at home, potentially alone, ceasing all intimate contact with people outside, locking down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was surprisingly successful in 2020, as a response to a sudden disaster, but it isn’t a realistic long-term strategy. The cultural, social and political history of the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/dec/01/response-aids-hiv-stigma-discrimination-drug-use-homophobia"&gt;HIV pandemic&lt;/a&gt; taught us that this epidemiological approach of trying to protect a population chiefly by focusing on ideal individual behavioural guidelines doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;João Florêncio is senior lecturer in history of modern and contemporary art and visual culture at the University of Exeter&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/21/hiv-epidemic-data-covid-public-health-messaging"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The best way to stay safe from Covid in England? Don't ditch the mask | Claire Horwell</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/20/covid-england-mask-boris-johnson-omicron</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Boris Johnson’s easing of restrictions is in stark contrast to what other countries are doing to control Omicron&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest"&gt;Coronavirus – latest updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak"&gt;See all our coronavirus coverage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Boris Johnson’s government announced that plan B measures for England, which were put in place in December, will be scrapped. This includes mandates on face coverings, which will no longer be compulsory in indoor public spaces from 27 January or for secondary school classrooms from 20 January. The Department for Education is likely to remove guidance on their use in school communal areas in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is in stark contrast to what other countries are doing in the midst of the Omicron pandemic – and let’s not forget, this is still a pandemic. With daily Covid-19 case numbers in the UK &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/"&gt;still above 100,000&lt;/a&gt;, and a daily average of &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths?areaType=overview&amp;amp;areaName=United%20Kingdom"&gt;more than 250 deaths&lt;/a&gt; within 28 days of a positive test, our situation is among the &lt;a href="https://covid19.who.int/table"&gt;worst in the world&lt;/a&gt;. Though our case numbers are indeed falling, this may well be partly due to the measures imposed in plan B, such as wearing face masks and working from home. There is a risk that the removal of these measures could reverse this trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claire Horwell is professor of geohealth at Durham University and has an honorary contract with the UK Health Security Agency&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/20/covid-england-mask-boris-johnson-omicron"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Now that science has defanged Covid, it’s time to get on with our lives | Devi Sridhar</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/19/science-covid-ineradicable-disease-prevention</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As with any other ineradicable disease, prevention and treatment can be integrated into society&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delaying and preventing infection as much as possible through this pandemic was a worthwhile strategy. In early 2020, there were few treatments, limited testing and no vaccines. The costs of those lockdowns were big, but the effort to buy time paid off. In that time, science has transformed Covid from a deadly virus to a much less serious, nasty disease – one that is manageable at home, for the vast majority of those vaccinated. It has, largely, defanged it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even as we have had success treating and preventing serious infections, Sars-CoV-2 has become increasingly transmissible. ONS survey data indicates that &lt;a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/5january2022"&gt;one in 15 are positive&lt;/a&gt; in England, with similar numbers for the other three nations. While the good news is that the Omicron variant is resulting in less severe disease and a smaller fraction of hospitalisations, so many people are infected and isolating that critical services are struggling with staffing. This is what is driving governments to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-54239922"&gt;rethink isolation policies&lt;/a&gt;, and ask whether they are becoming more disruptive than the virus itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/19/science-covid-ineradicable-disease-prevention"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Djokovic circus allows us to see all our Covid prejudices being played out | Emma John</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/16/novak-djokovic-fellow-players-have-given-the-rest-of-us-a-lesson-in-tolerance</link>
      <description>With its breadth of opinions, the tennis locker room is society in miniature&lt;p&gt;Stefanos Tsitsipas learned to listen to Covid science the hard way. Not the really hard way, of course. Not the hard way that more unfortunate vaccine-resisters have experienced, after they’ve ingested conspiracy theories about side effects and regurgitated social media promises that there’s no risk to the young and healthy. The world’s No 4-ranked tennis player didn’t, mercifully, find himself laid low by the virus or on a ventilator in hospital – he just found himself publicly rebuked by his own government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Tsitsipas’s father-cum-coach, Apostolos, &lt;a href="https://www.thenationalherald.com/tsitsipas-says-young-should-get-covid-19-to-build-immunity/" title=""&gt;gave interviews&lt;/a&gt; claiming that “athletes have a strong enough immune system to deal with any challenge”, Greece’s government spokesman was &lt;a href="https://greekcitytimes.com/2021/08/20/greek-government-responds-to-tsitsipas-vaccine-comments/" title=""&gt;pointing out&lt;/a&gt; that a 23-year-old tennis player, however successful in his field, had “neither the knowledge, nor the studies, nor the research work” to offer valid opinions on vaccination. The story had a happy ending, though: Tsitsipas did indeed stop spouting poorly informed conjecture and got himself jabbed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/16/novak-djokovic-fellow-players-have-given-the-rest-of-us-a-lesson-in-tolerance"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The NHS isn’t ‘coping’ with Omicron – just ask doctors and patients | Rachel Clarke</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/15/nhs-coping-doctors-patients-omicron</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest about what riding out this wave really means: more pressures on health workers, and lower standards of care&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We tell ourselves stories in order to live,” wrote the late, great Joan Didion. But what if the narratives we compulsively weave end up being the death of us? Another &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/"&gt;335 deaths&lt;/a&gt; within 28 days of a diagnosis of Covid were recorded on Thursday, even as the pandemic is being dismissed as essentially over by many in the government and media. “Endemicity” is the new virological watchword of 2022, meaning – at least when touted by those opposed to Covid restrictions – the mutation of Sars-CoV-2 into something so mild and weedy it is no more threatening than a common cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet 335 deaths are an entire jumbo jet’s worth of people, crashing from the sky above. Has it really taken less than two years to become inured to such dizzying daily casualties? Perhaps, if we are honest with ourselves, what herd immunity really means is our newfound capacity to render ourselves emotionally untouched by – immune to – mass loss of life. The departed as no more than a hum of background noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rachel Clarke is a palliative care doctor and the author of &lt;a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/breathtaking-9781408713785.html"&gt;Breathtaking&lt;/a&gt;: Inside the NHS in a Time of Pandemic&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/15/nhs-coping-doctors-patients-omicron"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Rory Kinnear: On the day of No 10’s lockdown party, I buried my sister</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/12/rory-kinnear-no-10-lockdown-party-buried-sister</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pain like ours was tearing through families the world over. It felt like we were all in it together. Not all of us, it turned out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without wishing to sound like an episode of Poirot, I remember well what I was doing on the evening of 20 May 2020, when more than 100 people were invited to a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/10/email-shows-boris-johnsons-official-invited-no-10-staff-to-lockdown-byob-party"&gt;BYOB party&lt;/a&gt; in the prime minister’s garden, “to make the most of the lovely weather”. While they recovered from an “exceptionally busy period” with, it might be presumed, laughter, companionship and their own bottles of wine, I was at my house. Like them, I, too, had a glass of wine, although I had drunk it by myself. I had then gone for a walk around my block where I had bumped into a friend out on his “daily permitted exercise”. We spoke a little, at a distance of more than two metres. He offered his condolences. I thanked him and returned home, alone. 20 May 2020 was the day I buried my sister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like those assembled with their bottles in Downing Street, I, too, had broken the government’s existing guidelines, implemented to mitigate the spread of Covid-19, in a familiar garden. After my sister Karina’s funeral, I had gone to my mother’s house. It was a baking hot day and, while the circumstances didn’t really allow me to “make the most of the lovely weather”, the sunshine did permit me and my other sister, Kirsty, to sit in our mum’s garden, at the state-appointed distance from each other, and recall the many joys, as well as strains, that Karina’s life had brought. There were three of us in the garden, from three separate households, one more than was permitted. It might not have been exactly to the letter of the law, but we reckoned it was the least our grief would permit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rory Kinnear is an actor and playwright&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/12/rory-kinnear-no-10-lockdown-party-buried-sister"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Brexit’s effects on UK trade are dramatic – but we feel them in the EU too | Lisandra Flach</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/02/brexits-effects-on-uk-trade-are-dramatic-but-we-feel-them-in-the-eu-too</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not only is the impact on goods profound, the split may have made the bloc more inward-looking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brexit formally took effect two years ago this week, but the economic and political consequences are still unfolding. It is clear that the UK has manoeuvred itself economically into a difficult situation by leaving the single market. Now, in addition, recent numbers show dramatic consequences for a country that is struggling to recover from the pandemic. In October 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.ifo.de/publikationen/2022/aufsatz-zeitschrift/strategien-gegen-die-flaschenhals-rezession-was-hilft-bei"&gt;trade in the eurozone exceeded&lt;/a&gt; pre-Covid December 2019 levels by 4%, whereas the UK stagnated at a much lower level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK trade had shown signs of a strong recovery from the coronavirus shock by the end of 2020, but this fell back significantly in 2021. Research undertaken by the IFO (Institute for Economic Research) in Munich suggests that further negative effects have materialised as the British economy adjusts to an array of non-tariff barriers ushered in when the Brexit transition period ended on 1 January 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lisandra Flach is director of the Center for International Economics at the Munich-based IFO (Institute for Economic Research) and professor of economics at Ludwig Maximilian University&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/02/brexits-effects-on-uk-trade-are-dramatic-but-we-feel-them-in-the-eu-too"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>From eastern Europe we watch Ukraine in fear. Its fate could decide the continent’s future</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2022/feb/01/eastern-europe-ukraine-fear-russia-cold-war</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Past trauma means we worry about Russia reclaiming its cold war sphere of influence and that the west will again abandon us&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two points about the Ukraine crisis are crystal clear. First, Vladimir Putin wishes to reimpose Russian control over Ukraine, whatever the price. His political dream of restoring the Soviet sphere of influence is echoed in a wishlist of “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/17/russia-issues-list-demands-tensions-europe-ukraine-nato"&gt;security guarantees&lt;/a&gt;” presented to western governments by Russia in December 2021. Nato, he maintains, should return to the pre-1997 state of affairs; Russia, apparently, need not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, whatever Putin decides in the current crisis, there are real fears in central and eastern Europe that settled borders are now under threat. These fears are grounded in reason. What seemed unrealistic in the immediate post-cold war years is now again a real possibility. Questions about our collective safety and security have returned, along with memories of a traumatic and not so remote past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karolina Wigura is a historian of ideas, board member of the Kultura Liberalna Foundation in Warsaw and a fellow at the Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jarosław Kuisz is a political analyst and essayist, editor-in-chief of the Polish weekly Kultura Liberalna and a policy fellow at the University of Cambridge&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guardian Newsroom: Will Russia invade Ukraine? &lt;/strong&gt;Join Mark Rice-Oxley, Andrew Roth, Luke Harding, Nataliya Gumenyuk and Orysia Lutsevych discussing the developments with Russia and Ukraine on Tuesday 8 February, 8pm GMT | 9pm CET | midday PDT | 3pm EDT.

      <title>Why Europe’s Muslims are braced for France’s stint running the EU presidency | Shada Islam</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2022/jan/03/europes-muslims-braced-frances-eu-presidency</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is concern that the country’s divisive anti-Muslim political discourse will seep into the union’s institutional policymaking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shada Islam is a Brussels-based commentator on EU affairs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;France has taken over the rotating EU &lt;a href="https://presidence-francaise.consilium.europa.eu/en/"&gt;presidency&lt;/a&gt; for the next six months, an opportunity the president, Emmanuel Macron, will no doubt use to nudge Europe towards his goal of greater “&lt;a href="https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/89865/why-european-strategic-autonomy-matters_en"&gt;strategic autonomy&lt;/a&gt;” in the world. &lt;a href="https://euobserver.com/opinion/153720"&gt;Some in Brussels worry&lt;/a&gt; that hotly contested presidential elections in April could interfere with France’s EU presidency before a key &lt;a href="https://futureu.europa.eu/?locale=en"&gt;conference on the future of Europe&lt;/a&gt; delivers any results. It’s not reassuring that Macron’s decision, temporarily, to fly the blue and gold EU flag at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/france-removes-eu-flag-arc-de-triomphe-rightwing-anger"&gt;already drawn the fury&lt;/a&gt; of far-right and conservative election candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many European Muslims are concerned about the French stint in the EU chair for another reason: they fear that France’s divisive anti-Muslim political discourse will seep dangerously into EU policymaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shada Islam is a Brussels-based commentator on EU affairs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2022/jan/03/europes-muslims-braced-frances-eu-presidency"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Faced with Covid, Europe’s citizens demanded an EU response – and got it | Luuk van Middelaar</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2021/dec/29/covid-europe-citizens-eu-response-pandemic-european-health</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The pandemic finally brought into being a European public, as we discovered that our health is a common concern&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 2020: an insidious virus seeds itself &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance"&gt;across the globe&lt;/a&gt; pitching tens of thousands in the European continent into a life-and-death battle. Most European countries secure their borders; millions of households lock their front doors. Hellish scenes flash by, feeding fears of infection. In Europe a disaster is unfolding, but there is no joint response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loudest cry comes from Italy, hit by the virus early on. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/15/revealed-the-inside-story-of-europes-divided-coronavirus-response"&gt;Appeals for help&lt;/a&gt; go unanswered and bitter reproaches ensue. The EU is slow to react: the fact that Brussels’ institutions lack the “competences”, or formal powers, to act in the field of public health impresses no one. When, soon thereafter, an economic depression looms, prophets of doom start predicting the end of the EU.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2021/dec/29/covid-europe-citizens-eu-response-pandemic-european-health"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Johnson’s Savile smear was the scorched-earth tactic of a desperate, dangerous man | Jonathan Freedland</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/04/boris-johnson-savile-smear-pm-power-britain</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The PM’s behaviour this week was a reminder he will do and say anything to cling to power – no matter the cost to Britain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That sound you can hear is the whirr of 650 adding machines. At Westminster, MPs are totting up the costs, tallying the benefits and working out the balance of their own interests. On the Tory benches, they know a moment of decision is coming but they can’t be sure that moment is now. Does the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/03/boris-johnsons-policy-chief-quits-over-pms-scurrilous-savile-remark"&gt;resignation in disgust&lt;/a&gt; by one of Boris Johnson’s most loyal lieutenants signal the end times, or was Munira Mirza a backroom aide no voter had ever heard of? What if both things are true?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They think, chiefly, about their own seats. Their inboxes are bulging with constituents’ fury, but they hesitate before casting aside the winner of their &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/bombastic-boris-johnson-wins-huge-majority-on-promise-to-get-brexit-done"&gt;biggest election victory&lt;/a&gt; for more than 30 years. Some long for the dilemma to be resolved for them, perhaps by a development so dramatic – police action or the emergence of a damning photograph, or if an unexpurgated Sue Gray report turns out to be full of what one ex-minister calls “tawdry detail” – that a consensus will rapidly form that the Johnson show is over. The bandwagon will start rolling and they’ll be able to jump on it safely. But what if there is no such moment of clarity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/04/boris-johnson-savile-smear-pm-power-britain"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Tories won’t ‘level up’ the north while they’re in thrall to London | Simon Jenkins</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/04/tories-level-up-north-london-michael-gove</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The capital drains the UK of its young people. Michael Gove must put re-establishing local pride at the centre of his agenda&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Gove should be a bishop, not a politician. He smiles. He nods. He declares “missions” and blesses all and sundry. His current diocese is Britain’s northern cities, which are suffering the worst regional disparity of any OECD country and said to be crippling the British economy. Boris Johnson has acknowledged this in his “levelling up” agenda. But to govern is to govern, not just to mean well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gove’s Wednesday sermon on levelling up &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/02/levelling-up-gove-calls-time-on-postcode-lottery-as-strategy-launched"&gt;meant well&lt;/a&gt;, but he might have been speaking of a distant province of a forgotten empire. The people of the north, he said, deserved better transport, better education, better housing, training, health, science, anything you cared to mention. They should have it, God willing. He promised that mayors would be appointed, plans formulated and 22,000 civil servants sent out from London, like missionaries to the unwashed. But please don’t mention money. It is so vulgar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/04/tories-level-up-north-london-michael-gove"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Tories are in trouble – but history tells us a scandal can strengthen them | Andy Beckett</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/04/tories-trouble-scandal-strengthen-british-politics</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The party’s current crisis may be one of the sporadic upheavals that cements its longterm dominance of British politics &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re not a Tory, the past few months may have brought some pleasure after years of torment. Bad news for the Conservatives has suddenly started coming almost daily: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/03/boris-johnsons-policy-chief-quits-over-pms-scurrilous-savile-remark"&gt;misfiring smear campaigns&lt;/a&gt;, chaotic U-turns, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/sue-gray-report-criticises-no-10-over-difficult-to-justify-parties"&gt;potentially lethal investigations&lt;/a&gt;, Tory MPs and rightwing papers turning on Boris Johnson, panicky ministers struggling through interviews, leadership rivalries ruining policy announcements, and a sustained &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/15/boris-johnson-now-less-popular-than-theresa-may-as-polls-show-tories-dire-predicament"&gt;plunge in the opinion polls&lt;/a&gt;. The multiplying consequences of the Downing Street party scandals have changed the political atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The importance of all this should not be underestimated. A terrible government, the most lethally incompetent and probably the most corrupt in modern British history, may finally be beginning to be held to account. At the same time, Conservatism’s image – as a rarely nice but often realistic ruling ideology – is being badly damaged. Seemingly unknown to themselves, Johnson and his remaining loyalists are becoming a laughing stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnist&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/04/tories-trouble-scandal-strengthen-british-politics"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Reckless, Trumpian leadership is losing Johnson allies. It should lose him his job | Martin Kettle</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/04/boris-johnson-resignations-munira-mirza-tobias-ellwood</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The resignations of Munira Mirza and other aides should galvanise Tory MPs to do what they must now do&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In writing about politics you can either try to explain what you think is happening or you can say what you think should happen. Right now, there is a complete convergence between the two. Boris Johnson’s premiership is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/02/boris-johnson-ex-minister-tobias-ellwood-to-submit-letter-of-no-confidence-in-pm"&gt;on the slide&lt;/a&gt;, irreversibly so. The question is not whether Johnson will go. It is when and how – and what will come after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously it is increasingly plain that Johnson &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; go. Some take this view for partisan reasons or because Johnson’s personality appals them. Fair enough. But that’s not my argument here. There is also an extremely powerful Conservative case against him remaining. In the end, this will be decisive, because he will only go only if it is in the Tory party’s interest; no one else’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/04/boris-johnson-resignations-munira-mirza-tobias-ellwood"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>A tale of two towns – one in the north, one in the south – exposes the lie of ‘levelling up’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/02/a-tale-of-two-towns-one-in-the-north-one-in-the-south-exposes-the-lie-of-levelling-up</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Instead of fixing the inequalities that run across the UK, Johnson’s Tories are combining culture war with electioneering&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a scene of little drama, yet says so much that it stays in my mind. A couple of years ago, I was reporting in Ashington, Northumberland, as Labour activists debated what to offer voters in the approaching mayoral elections. The meeting room was inside the library, which was inside the council’s gym, which was inside a shiny great glass and steel hulk knocked up by Carillion, the giant that used to hoover up those PFI contracts – until it &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/15/carillion-collapse-two-years-on-government-has-learned-nothing"&gt;went bust&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A town built on coal, Ashington had been home to the Pitmen Painters – the extraordinary &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/sep/17/in-praise-of-pitman-painters"&gt;band of miners&lt;/a&gt; who turned themselves into artists – but that economy and its traditions were long gone. The morning had been spent on a fairly fruitless round of door-knocking nearby, the voters glaring at the Labour members as if they were bothersome Jehovahs, while the wind whipped in from the North Sea. On one side of the library stood a huge Asda, on the other a big Lidl, offering their customers cheap food and their workers low wages. This was today’s vista: a bombed-out economy, an electorate estranged from politics, and a visibly shrinking public sector getting picked over for cash by a parasitic private sector. You couldn’t ask for a clearer picture of austerity Britain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the end, I was collared by a woman. She’d been a teacher nearby and she wanted me to understand that, for her kids, places such as the Guardian, parliament and the Natural History Museum were impossibly far away. Long hours on the coach required cash their parents didn’t have and days their schools couldn’t afford. “They’ve never been to central London,” she said. “They live in a different country.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/02/a-tale-of-two-towns-one-in-the-north-one-in-the-south-exposes-the-lie-of-levelling-up"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Johnson’s ‘Brexit freedoms bill’ won’t set us free. But it will reward his supporters | George Monbiot</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The wealthy ghouls who fund the Tory party expect their quid pro quo – and this legislation will deliver it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To adapt &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCedOQJ0ZEA"&gt;Ronald Reagan’s adage&lt;/a&gt;, the nine most terrifying words in the English language are “I’m from the government, and I’ll set you free.” Every time this government says freedom, it means freedom for someone other than you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeking to distract us from his own pursuit of freedom during lockdown, this week Boris Johnson announced what he calls a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-pledges-brexit-freedoms-bill-to-cut-eu-red-tape"&gt;Brexit freedoms bill&lt;/a&gt;. Its purpose is to accelerate the removal of EU rules from our legislation, and to “cut £1 billion of red tape for UK businesses”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/02/johnsons-brexit-freedoms-bill-wont-set-us-free-but-it-will-reward-his-supporters"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Never mind wine fridges, the Tory party is drunk on Kool-Aid | Marina Hyde</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/01/wine-fridges-tory-party-kool-aid</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, Conservative MPs really are rallying around a PM who used a paedophile-based conspiracy theory as a figleaf&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you ever wondered what Jim Jones’s corpse would have looked like if it had spent three weeks getting bleached and bloated by a Guyana river, it floated up to the House of Commons dispatch box &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/01/zero-shame-how-the-papers-covered-anger-at-boris-johnson-over-sue-gray-report"&gt;yesterday at 3.30pm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin with some real talk. The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/sue-gray-report-criticises-no-10-over-difficult-to-justify-parties"&gt;prime minister is under police investigation&lt;/a&gt; for multiple breaches of his own Covid laws. At least four gatherings or parties in which Boris Johnson was directly involved are being probed by the Met, including one in his private flat. In total, police are investigating 12 potentially law-breaking Downing Street parties which took place after the British people had been ordered – BY HIM – to live under the most draconian restrictions imposed in peacetime. The Global Britain that Johnson promised saw him yesterday bin off a call to the Russian president, who is apparently on the brink of an invasion, so that he could explain that he needs to wait for police officers to decide if he went to an illicit party in his own home. The Conservative MPs somehow able to make their peace with all this increasingly resemble cult members accepting the latest transparent lies and failures of a cult leader.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/01/wine-fridges-tory-party-kool-aid"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Sue Gray report on No 10 parties: our writers on what should happen next | Nesrine Malik and others</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/31/sue-gray-report-no-10-boris-johnson</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With some of Sue Gray’s findings published, what will the implications be for Boris Johnson? Our experts give their view&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any normal political climate, the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/what-sue-gray-edited-report-into-alleged-lockdown-parties-says"&gt;Sue Gray report&lt;/a&gt; should be a final word. It is not short on statements that should condemn the prime minister, confirming the facts that have been out in the public domain for weeks now. Twelve parties – all but four of those that took place – are under criminal investigation. One of those, and this is not a passing detail, took place in the prime minister’s own flat. While the rest of the country was negotiating the fine technicalities of what constitutes a breach of the rules, in some instances pondering whether to sit on a bench in the park or not, these parties seem to suggest that No 10 and civil service staff, under the eye of the prime minister, believed they were exempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/31/sue-gray-report-no-10-boris-johnson"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Putin knows exactly what he wants in eastern Europe – unlike the west | Timothy Garton Ash</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/31/putin-russia-eastern-europe-ukraine</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Until we stop dithering and commit to all European states being independent and free, Russia will have the upper hand&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Russian troops mass on the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/30/nato-calls-on-europe-to-diversify-energy-supply-amid-russia-standoff"&gt;frontiers of Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;, threatening the largest war in Europe since 1945, the whole world is trying to guess Vladimir Putin’s intentions. But the strategic question the democracies of Europe and North America need to ask is: what are &lt;em&gt;our &lt;/em&gt;intentions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putin’s long-term goal in eastern Europe is, in fact, perfectly clear. He wants to restore as much as possible of the empire, great power status and sphere of influence that Russia lost so dramatically 30 years ago, with the disintegration of the Soviet Union in December 1991. It is only his tactics that keep us guessing. Since 2008, when he secured two secessionist &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/12/georgia1"&gt;chunks of Georgia&lt;/a&gt; by force, and most certainly since his &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/27/ukraine-pro-russian-gunmen-seize-crimea-parliament-live-updates"&gt;seizure of Crimea&lt;/a&gt; in 2014, it has been evident that he is ready to use any and all means, from diplomacy and disinformation to cyber-attacks and outright war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timothy Garton Ash is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guardian Newsroom: Will Russia invade Ukraine? &lt;/strong&gt;Join Mark Rice-Oxley, Andrew Roth, Luke Harding, Nataliya Gumenyuk and Orysia Lutsevych discussing the developments with Russia and Ukraine on Tuesday 8 February, 8pm GMT | 9pm CET | midday PDT | 3pm EDT.

      <title>There’s a smarter way to fix the social care crisis than raising national insurance | Polly Toynbee</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/31/social-care-crisis-raising-national-insurance-nhs-northumbria</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Northumbria’s NHS trust could be a model for integrating health and social care, as well as paying staff a better wage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime minister and chancellor have bolted themselves together in a mutual destruction pact. Come hell or high water, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/28/middle-income-earners-hit-hardest-national-insurance-higher-percentage-uk-rishi-sunak"&gt;the national insurance rise&lt;/a&gt; will happen, rudely snubbing a campaign by the Daily Mail. The Tory right wants no tax rises and no spending, while Labour wants the highest tax burden to be paid by those who have the most. But instead of hitting older people, or the unearned income of rich people, this tax will be paid by young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a political shocker: the NI rise will take £255 a year from typical earnings, in perfect synchronicity with the explosion &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/08/cost-of-living-squeeze-how-much-worse-off-will-you-be-in-2022"&gt;in fuel bills, council tax rises&lt;/a&gt; and inflation, which is on track to reach &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/31/bank-of-england-poised-to-raise-interest-rates-as-high-inflation-takes-toll"&gt;6% by April&lt;/a&gt;. The government has also ruled out abolishing VAT on fuel, another regressive tax. This is an epic case of political and policy mismanagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article was amended on 4 February 2022. An earlier version mentioned Northumbria University in connection with a possible training academy. The academy plan has yet to partner with a university.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/31/social-care-crisis-raising-national-insurance-nhs-northumbria"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Lying didn’t work for Boris Johnson, so now he’s turned to bribery | Simon Jenkins</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/31/boris-johnson-lying-bribery-partygate</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The prime minister’s response to ‘partygate’ is a wild orgy of populist policies to keep up the pretence he’s still in charge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past fortnight Sue Gray’s report on “partygate” has been hovering over Downing Street like a huge vulture, seeking only somewhere to land. A redacted version is expected imminently. In the meantime, Boris Johnson is panicking. For partygate he has substituted policygate, a wild orgy of populist pronouncements designed to show he is still in charge. If Johnson cannot &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/28/sue-gray-report-britain-liar-met-police-partygate-report"&gt;lie himself out of trouble&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps he can bribe himself out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you want, everyone? I would get the Treasury to let you off extra taxes, if only that mean Rishi Sunak would let me. I can promise help with gas bills and heating allowances. I can shower the north of England with money and mayors. I can let you visit your loved ones in care homes, perhaps.

      <title>The post-Brexit economic crisis never materialised – Labour is right to move on | Larry Elliott</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/31/post-brexit-economic-crisis-labour-eu-britain</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The unpopular truth is that leaving the EU has not magically transformed Britain, but nor has it been calamitous&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plenty of people – on the left as well as the right – believed George Osborne when he conjured up a dystopian vision of Britain after a vote for Brexit during the final weeks of the referendum campaign. The then chancellor said victory for leave would result in a “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/22/brexit-would-cause-diy-recession-says-george-osborne"&gt;DIY recession&lt;/a&gt;”, the loss of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/24/boris-johnson-eu-referendum-job-loss"&gt;800,000 jobs&lt;/a&gt;, a weaker housing market and a stock market crash. Two years on from our date of departure from the EU, none of it has happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unemployment is &lt;a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peoplenotinwork/unemployment/timeseries/mgsx/lms"&gt;lower than it was in 2016&lt;/a&gt; and, although this is very much a mixed blessing, house prices are higher. Share prices have risen and until Covid-19 arrived there was no recession. That hasn’t halted the flow of gloomy predictions: Nissan would quit the UK, tens of thousands of City jobs would be lost to Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam. More recently, Brexit supply chain problems would mean a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/26/christmas-turkeys-scarcer-uk-supermarkets-brexit-shortage"&gt;turkey-less Christmas&lt;/a&gt; and empty high street shelves in December. None of that happened either, and the wait for economic meltdown goes on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larry Elliott is the Guardian’s economics editor&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/31/post-brexit-economic-crisis-labour-eu-britain"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Renaissance Florence is a ludicrous model for levelling up | Letters</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2022/feb/07/renaissance-florence-is-a-ludicrous-model-for-levelling-up</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauro Martines &lt;/strong&gt;gives us a history lesson on the reality of life in Renaissance Florence. Plus letters from &lt;strong&gt;Michael Sanders,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Sylvia Dunkley &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; Yvonne Williams&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy Haldane, co-author of the government’s big levelling-up report, wants to pair a swathe of the UK’s major material needs with the thrust of achievements in Renaissance Florence (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/05/levelling-up-report-author-uk-like-renaissance-florence" title=""&gt;Report, 5 February&lt;/a&gt;). It would be difficult to entertain a more idiotic vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florence had no coordination between public expenditure and urban improvement. Taxation staggered from one need to the next. Churches and rich patrons were the prime movers behind all major architectural commissions. Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci deserted Florence for more promising venues. The Medici began to put their hands into the public till even under the 15th-century republic. Any conception of the public good was rudimentary. The political upper class swiftly made its peace with the overmighty Medici in the 16th century. Enough said.&lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauro Martines&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;em&gt;London&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2022/feb/07/renaissance-florence-is-a-ludicrous-model-for-levelling-up"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Boris Johnson’s death by a thousand cuts harms us all | Letters</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/07/boris-johnsons-death-by-a-thousand-cuts-harms-us-all</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Riddle &lt;/strong&gt;says that while the prime minister&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;blusters on, it is the rest of us who will experience the slow bleed of increasing prices and taxes, while &lt;strong&gt;Geoff Reid &lt;/strong&gt;is concerned about who will replace him&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nesrine Malik colourfully describes the protracted demise of Boris Johnson as a “slow bleed, rather than an immediate fall” (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/07/government-fantasy-reality-tories-boris-johnson-lies-conservative" title=""&gt;This government has been built on a fantasy. Restoring reality will cost the Tories dear, 7 February&lt;/a&gt;). She rightly suggests that because the Conservative party narrative is built on lies, it will reframe the prime minister’s lies and allow him to live another day, and then another, and yet another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those of us who have written to our local Conservative MPs about our distress at partygate and the flouting of rules seem to all have received replies with common phrases indicating that action is being taken to improve the operation at No 10. Not one word of contrition or recognition of the prime minister’s individual failings and personal responsibility.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/07/boris-johnsons-death-by-a-thousand-cuts-harms-us-all"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Why we should be asking for big pay rises | Letter</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/07/why-we-should-be-asking-for-big-pay-rises</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goods and services that keep the high street afloat come from the spending of the masses, not the rich, says &lt;strong&gt;David Redshaw&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, it’s remarkable to see how little is understood about the workings of capitalism by those who operate at the very top of it (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/04/bank-of-england-boss-calls-for-wage-restraint-to-help-control-inflation" title=""&gt;Bank of England boss criticised for asking workers not to demand pay rise, 4 February&lt;/a&gt;). “The rich cannot buy great quantities of bread,” the economist JK Galbraith observed after the Wall Street crash of 1929 and America’s struggle to revive its economy. He meant that the goods and services that keep the high street (and its suppliers and manufacturers) going come from the everyday spending of the masses, not from the activities of the very few mega-rich speculators and rentiers who always end up causing volatility and boom and bust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While no one would want a return to the union militancy of the 1970s, it was pointed out at the time by some economists that at least the big pay rises to workers put money in their pockets to spend, which stopped the economy tilting into recession.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/07/why-we-should-be-asking-for-big-pay-rises"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>A postcode lottery that I just can’t win | Brief letters</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Home truths | Homage to Lata Mangeshkar | The new Wordle | A gift that keeps on giving&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I moved into a newly built house in June 2020. HMRC has still not updated my postcode on its records, so passport and driving licence renewals have had to be completed by post. I have tried to complain about this using the online complaints system. After spending 45 minutes completing six pages of the signing-in process, and receiving a one-time password and my 12-digit ID, I was asked for … my postcode. &lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Rotheram&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preston, Lancashire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• It’s hard to impress on non-south Asians what Lata Mangeshkar meant to one-sixth of humanity (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/06/lata-mangeshkar-singer-bollywood-india-dies-92" title=""&gt;Lata Mangeshkar, legendary Bollywood singer, dies at 92, 6 February&lt;/a&gt;). She was the background music of the lives of millions over many decades.

      <title>Taking the heat out of soaring energy prices | Letters</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/06/taking-the-heat-out-of-soaring-energy-prices</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diana Wilkins&lt;/strong&gt; spells out measures to curb energy consumption,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; Andrew Knowles &lt;/strong&gt;bemoans the privatisation of essential services. Plus letters from &lt;strong&gt;Hilary Lang &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; Dr Christopher Sait&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid all the discussion about how to mitigate the cost of energy price rises for households (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/03/millions-uk-fuel-poverty-sunak-support-rising-energy-bills-low-income-households" title=""&gt;Report, 3 February&lt;/a&gt;), there has been no mention of how to cut energy use in the first place. Rather than offset the cost by discounts, the money would be better used to reduce long-term energy consumption by making buildings as energy-efficient as possible and thereby helping to meet climate change commitments, too. It’s not rocket science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can go a long way to improve the situation by ensuring lofts are insulated, windows are double-glazed and fit correctly, letterbox holes are plugged and external mailboxes fitted instead, draught excluders are fitted around wooden front doors, curtains have thermal linings etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/06/taking-the-heat-out-of-soaring-energy-prices"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Children in care are in dire need of mental health support | Letters</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/06/children-in-care-are-in-dire-need-of-mental-health-support</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah Champion MP&lt;/strong&gt; highlights the needs of young people in care, and &lt;strong&gt;Steven Walker&lt;/strong&gt; points to the underfunding of child and adolescent mental health services&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your report (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/04/social-workers-warn-of-rise-in-mental-health-problems-among-children" title=""&gt;4 February&lt;/a&gt;) on the rise in mental health problems among children was an incredibly important insight into the challenges they are facing. But for children and young people who have been in care, the situation is even more dire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looked-after children are already at significantly higher risk of experiencing poor mental health than their peers. Despite there only being 67 children in care for every 10,000, these individuals make up 24% of the prison population and 25% of the homeless population in the UK. What’s more, as stated in a recent report by the children’s rights campaign &lt;a href="https://serenitywelfare.org/page/hope-instead-of-handcuffs.html" title=""&gt;Hope Instead of Handcuffs&lt;/a&gt;, young people who have spent time in care are significantly more likely than their peers to find themselves classified as not in education, employment or training.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/06/children-in-care-are-in-dire-need-of-mental-health-support"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Shielding vulnerable people from Covid | Letter</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/06/shielding-vulnerable-people-from-covid</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Patmore &lt;/strong&gt;suggests measures to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;protect those who feel abandoned after the relaxation of social distancing and mask-wearing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are permanent public health measures that could reduce the Covid-19 worries of vulnerable people as infection-control measures are removed, as highlighted in your article (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/i-dont-want-to-die-the-shielders-who-fear-the-end-of-covid-restrictions" title=""&gt;‘I don’t want to die’: the shielders who fear the end of Covid restrictions, 2 February&lt;/a&gt;). A proportion of train carriages could be reserved for people wearing masks, as in the era of smoking and non-smoking carriages. Downstairs on buses could serve passengers with masks, upstairs for those without. At supermarkets some tills could be reserved for queues of customers with masks. Cinemas and theatres could reserve a block of seats for those with masks. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These could be permanent measures that benefit people who are keen to avoid infection and provide a safety option for others at times of heightened infection. This would also benefit the economy, since there are plenty of at-risk people, not least among Britain’s large pensioner population, who will withhold their spending from businesses unless such commonsense safety options are offered. &lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Patmore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;em&gt;York&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/06/shielding-vulnerable-people-from-covid"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>No word of a lie, I’m not ‘doing a Boris’ | Brief letters</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/06/no-word-of-a-lie-im-not-doing-a-boris</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being truthful | Detecting nonsense | Simon Parkin | Popularity contest | Drinking in Ireland | Shelf love&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week I found myself saying: “No, I am telling the truth, I’m not doing a Boris Johnson.” Am I the first person to say this useful self-evident phrase?&lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard Dimbleby&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Northampton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Boris Johnson apparently praised Munira Mirza as a “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/03/munira-mirza-boris-johnsons-powerful-nonsense-detector" title=""&gt;powerful nonsense detector&lt;/a&gt;” (3 February). Rather surprising then that it took her 14 years to detect the “nonsense’” right under her nose. &lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Cottee&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cambridge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/06/no-word-of-a-lie-im-not-doing-a-boris"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
