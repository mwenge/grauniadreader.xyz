      <title>From Spencer to Licorice Pizza: why are women suddenly running on film?</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/07/from-spencer-to-licorice-pizza-why-are-women-suddenly-running-on-film</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;New movies feature key scenes of central female characters legging it down streets or through fields. Is cinema finally keeping pace with real life? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a moment in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/04/spencer-review-kristen-stewarts-diana-impersonation-is-enjoyably-strange"&gt;Spencer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Pablo Larraín’s imagining of an ill-fated weekend at Sandringham for Diana, Princess of Wales (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/oct/29/kristen-stewart-on-playing-diana-i-believe-in-a-lingering-energy-i-took-her-in"&gt;Kristen Stewart&lt;/a&gt;), when Prince Charles (Jack Farthing) tells his wife, “You have to be able to make your body do things you hate. For the good of the country.” Diana grips the edge of a billiards table as if trying to hold herself together; behind white knuckles, satin, and perfect hair, untapped rage is seething.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diana’s fight to contain herself – to remain statue-like, elegant, and prim – repeatedly threatens to boil over. When it does, she&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;does not take Charles’s advice. Instead, she runs as if her life depends on it. In a surreal montage of her past and present selves, Larraín shows a 12-year-old Diana chasing her friends on the lawn, then at 17, flying past in a school uniform, and at 20, tripping on the hem of her wedding dress, but hurtling on regardless. She is wild, unrestrained, luminous, and free, and the sequence is one of the film’s most moving and exuberant moments – one that precipitates Diana’s decision to live on her own terms, not those of the royal family.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/07/from-spencer-to-licorice-pizza-why-are-women-suddenly-running-on-film"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Lata Mangeshkar obituary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/07/lata-mangeshkar-obituary</link>
      <description>One of India’s most famous playback singers hailed as ‘the nightingale of Bollywood’ who had a four-octave vocal range&lt;p&gt;Lata Mangeshkar, “the nightingale of Bollywood”, who has died aged 92 after contracting Covid-19, was a much-loved Indian national and international figure, whose songs provided the backdrop to the lives of millions for seven decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music sung by her was heard constantly across India, in shops, restaurants, taxis or on the radio, and she became known as “Didi”, or sister, because so many people identified with her often emotional songs. And yet she was best known as a playback singer, a vocalist who does not appear onscreen but provides the soundtrack for films in which actors lip sync to her singing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/07/lata-mangeshkar-obituary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Help review – dizzying psychodrama that gets domestic violence all wrong</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/07/help-review-a-dizzyingly-dismal-psychodrama-blake-ridder</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If the drama wasn’t bad enough, a dog dies in this poorly conceived thriller that suffers from wooden acting and turgid pacing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dull, stilted, suspense drama is not to be confused with either the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/sep/16/help-review-jodie-comer-and-stephen-graham-will-leave-you-breathless-with-rage"&gt;excellent TV series of the same name&lt;/a&gt; starring &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/stephen-graham"&gt;Stephen Graham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/jodie-comer"&gt;Jodie Comer&lt;/a&gt;, or the Beatles’ larky 1965 collaboration with director Richard Lester (same title, but with extra punctuation). Perhaps this Help’s writer-director, Blake Ridder, and his producers were hoping that folks surfing streaming platforms might click on their production thinking it was either of these two far superior entertainments. Accidental viewers are not likely to stick with this unless they really want to know what happens to three or so thinly drawn characters locked in a psychodrama of suspicion, betrayal and unconvincingly faked lust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having just split up with her long-distance lover, Grace (Emily Redpath) comes to visit her old friend Liv (Sarah Alexandra Marks) and partner Edward (Louis James) in the countryside. A neighbour, David (played by Ridder himself), who appears to either be autistic or have another neurodivergent condition, warns Grace enigmatically as she arrives that “it’s bad”. This, presumably, applies to Liv and Edward’s tempestuous relationship but could just as easily be a judgment on the film itself. Gradually, Grace realises that there is violence happening behind closed doors, but the big twist reveals that things are not as they seem. While we wouldn’t want to spoil the surprise, we can’t let it pass that the reveal is predicated on a very dodgy understanding of a particular type of domestic violence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/07/help-review-a-dizzyingly-dismal-psychodrama-blake-ridder"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Death on the Nile review – Kenneth Branagh makes heavy weather of Christie caper</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/07/death-on-the-nile-review-kenneth-branagh-agatha-christie</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Branagh’s spirited performance as Poirot and a big-name ensemble cast can’t keep this stale and two-dimensional whodunnit afloat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long coronavirally delayed, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/02/on-the-orient-express-review-kenneth-branagh-judi-dench-johnny-depp-agatha-christie"&gt;Kenneth Branagh’s latest Agatha Christie&lt;/a&gt; movie puffs effortfully into harbour. It’s the classic whodunnit about a murder on a steamer making its way down the river in Egypt with an Anglo-American boatful of waxy-faced cameos aboard. The horrible homicide means that one of the passengers will have to spring into action, and this is of course the amply moustached Hercule Poirot, played by Branagh himself. It is Poirot who interviews suspects, supervises corpse-storage in the ship’s galley freezer cabinet and delivers the final unmasking – and all without the captain insisting that the Egyptian police should possibly get involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenwriter Michael Green has adapted the 1937 novel with some new inventions: some people of colour are introduced, and Christie’s intense dislike for her wealthy-hypocrite leftwing character has been dialled down. Most startlingly, Green invents a very good prelude showing the young Poirot’s service in the trenches of the first world war, and the origin of that moustache. Nothing in the rest of this rather stale and two-dimensional tale matches the brio of that opening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/07/death-on-the-nile-review-kenneth-branagh-agatha-christie"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Dance review – slow-cinema maestro offers a glimpse behind the scenes</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/07/the-dance-review-slow-cinema-maestro-offers-a-glimpse-behind-the-scenes</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pat Collins turns his gaze on Irish dance and theatre troupe Teac Damsa in this fragmentary but emotional documentary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For fans of the terpsichorean arts, this documentary about the creation, rehearsal and debut of the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/06/mam-review-michael-keegan-dolan-sadlers-wells-teac-damsa"&gt;2019 work Mám, by Irish dance and theatre troupe Teac Damsa&lt;/a&gt;, will be a treat. That’s especially true given the pandemic disrupted Mám’s scheduled tour, so this may be one of the few chances for people to see some of it, although crucially not the whole thing. Instead, slow-cinema maestro Pat Collins (last seen with ethnology documentary &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/apr/13/henry-glassie-field-work-review-american-folklore-art-anthropology"&gt;Henry Glassie: Field Work&lt;/a&gt;) and no doubt longsuffering editor Keith Walsh have excerpted an assortment of moments and passages from the final staged version that they’ve montaged nimbly together, although sometimes the music heard doesn’t correspond to the dancing seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mám lacks any kind of story, and its creation was more about process than product for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/21/michael-keegan-dolan-handel-beautiful-darkness"&gt;choreographer Michael Keegan-Dolan&lt;/a&gt; and his ensemble, and so the film’s fragmentary, sliced-view approach works just fine. Keegan-Dolan, best known for his work in ballet and choreography for the Royal Opera House, explains to his collaborators near the start that he wants to make something that evades the usual hierarchies of dance, opening up a space for the performers to be as instrumental in the creative process as either Keegan-Dolan or his key collaborator Rachel Poirier (she’s also his wife). Meanwhile, just as essential to the process is the input from bravura concertina player Cormac Begley, who pulls together the score in a parallel collaboration with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_de_Ridder"&gt;stargaze&lt;/a&gt;, a musical combo using traditional instruments to make a heady sound that’s closest to contemporary classical but with bits of jazz and folk thrown in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/07/the-dance-review-slow-cinema-maestro-offers-a-glimpse-behind-the-scenes"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Olivia Colman overcomes Bafta snub to take London critics’ best actress award</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/07/olivia-colman-overcomes-bafta-snub-to-take-london-critics-best-actress-award</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Colman wins prize for her role in The Lost Daughter, while Jane Campion’s  western The Power of the Dog also triumphed taking home four awards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olivia Colman has been named actress of the year by the London Critics’ Circle film awards for her lead role in the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/elena-ferrante"&gt;Elena Ferrante&lt;/a&gt; adaptation &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/16/the-lost-daughter-review-olivia-colman-shines-in-elena-ferrante-missing-kid-drama"&gt;The Lost Daughter&lt;/a&gt;, in sharp contrast to the Bafta film awards’ failure to nominate her for its equivalent prize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directed by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/12/maggie-gyllenhaal-from-difficult-roles-to-lauded-hollywood-director"&gt;Maggie Gyllenhaal&lt;/a&gt;, The Lost Daughter is about an academic (played by Colman) on holiday in Greece who becomes involved with another family when their young daughter goes missing. Colman has already been nominated for a string of awards for the role, including the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild, and is expected to be nominated for the best actress Oscar when they are announced on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/07/olivia-colman-overcomes-bafta-snub-to-take-london-critics-best-actress-award"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>HipBeat review – a male identity crisis in Berlin is pure cringe</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/07/hipbeat-review-a-male-identity-crisis-in-berlin-is-pure-cringe</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The intoxicating, party-hard capital of Germany goes straight to the head of Samuel Kay Forrest’s feature debut – and not in a good way &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Wings of Desire to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jan/11/how-we-made-run-lola-run-franka-potente-berlin"&gt;Run Lola Run&lt;/a&gt;, from Cate Shortland’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/11/berlin-syndrome-review-tense-thriller"&gt;Berlin Syndrome&lt;/a&gt; to one-take wonder &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/03/victoria-sebastian-schipper-observer-review"&gt;Victoria&lt;/a&gt;, quite a few film-makers have been seduced by the liberating possibilities of the German capital. But too much freedom can often equate to directionless freestyling – and the authority-resistant, hard-partying, gender-fluid spirit of Berlin goes straight to the head of Irish writer-director Samuel Kay Forrest in this rambling and cringingly earnest feature debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrest plays wandering soul Angus, a twentysomething with a side-shave haircut and a thorny family background set on finding himself in the capital of Euro-hedonism. When he’s not railing against fascism and scarpering from the polizei, or oh-so-seditiously spray-painting his tag “HipBeat” around town, he has a budding relationship with local woman Angie (Marie Céline Yildirim). She’s unaware, though, that he’s sleeping around with members of both sexes – and, after a pep talk with an inspirational drag queen, becoming more intent on exploring the parts of himself in between.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/07/hipbeat-review-a-male-identity-crisis-in-berlin-is-pure-cringe"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Book of Love review – charmless romcom is a waste of potential</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/04/book-of-love-review-charmless-rom-com</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sam Claflin plays an uptight novelist on a Mexican book tour in a romantic comedy short on romance and comedy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since it was &lt;em&gt;insisted&lt;/em&gt; that Netflix had single-handledly resurrected the romantic comedy despite the general hideousness of the romcoms they were releasing, streamers have churned them out by the dozen, quality be damned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Valentine’s Day looms, with Netflix still basking in the success of last month’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/03/the-royal-treatment-netflix-bland-rom-com-smash-hit"&gt;The Royal Treatment&lt;/a&gt;, the next week will see the teen sequel Tall Girl 2 and Turkish offering Love Tactics also added to its catalogue. At the same time, Amazon will launch the Jenny Slate-Charlie Day comedy I Want You Back and Universal will give Marry Me, J-Lo’s glossy return to the genre, a hybrid cinema-Peacock launch. It’s a theoretical feast for fans, but here’s naively hoping that they’re a damn sight better than this week’s misfiring trifle Book of Love (dropping on Amazon in the US and on Sky in the UK), a colourless background watch that never once attempts to make itself worthy of more focused attention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/04/book-of-love-review-charmless-rom-com"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Moonfall review – Roland Emmerich’s bad moon rising… and I mean really bad</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/03/moonfall-review-halle-berry-patrick-wilson-roland-emmerich</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Halle Berry and Patrick Wilson are astronauts trying to save Earth from the falling moon in this gibberish big-budget folly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just before Christmas, Adam McKay released his &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/08/dont-look-up-review-slapstick-apocalypse-according-to-dicaprio-and-lawrence"&gt;all-star apocalypse satire Don’t Look Up&lt;/a&gt;, in which the political and media classes’ refusal to understand the danger of an approaching mega-comet was symbolic of climate-crisis denial. Sadly, that impeccably intentioned film turned out to be the celeb-comedy equivalent of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/05/gal-gadot-imagine-video"&gt;Gal Gadot’s Imagine video&lt;/a&gt;. But its admirers said those critics disliking it were, as journalists, naturally complicit in the problem, and that they didn’t care about the environment. This liberal-arts version of Trumpian journalist-hate was all the odder as most of those expressing it were themselves journalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of these issues apply to Moonfall, a film that is part of the well-established but humbler “disaster” genre, which paradoxically signals its lack of real concern in its deadly serious manner combined with a tacitly agreed happy ending, as opposed to satire concluding in tragedy. This bizarrely leaden new example of the action spectacular is from Roland Emmerich, a longtime master of these end-of-the-world-but-not-really films. But here the formulaic silliness, sometimes part of the enjoyment, is just tiring.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/03/moonfall-review-halle-berry-patrick-wilson-roland-emmerich"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Souvenir Part II review – a flood of austere sunlight in Joanna Hogg’s superb sequel</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/08/the-souvenir-part-ii-review-once-more-with-even-more-feeling</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hogg’s double-Swinton, highly autobiographical study of a young film-maker is less detached, more emotionally engaging, as we enter Julie’s world for a second time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It shouldn’t work, and maybe it shouldn’t even have got made. But it does and it has: and Joanna Hogg has given us an amazingly luminous self-portrait of the film-maker as a young woman: metatextual, confessional and autobiographical. And in two parts, what’s more, demanding our attention and getting it (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/29/the-souvenir-review-joanna-hogg"&gt;the first part came out in 2019&lt;/a&gt;). The Souvenir is a movie that has defied the laws of film industry gravity, and those big names in the credits don’t in themselves explain this: a film that has floated free of what might be expected commercially or in any other way and carries itself with a marvellous austere artistry and compositional flair. And the sunbursts of emotion in the musical soundtrack gave me enough vitamin D to last the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this second part, I found the things that were a challenge the first time around, such as its tendency to the opaque (although not unexpected for this director), have melted away, and the return of these characters is like the return of old friends and old lovers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/08/the-souvenir-part-ii-review-once-more-with-even-more-feeling"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Lingui, the Sacred Bonds review – ties that bind loyalty between mother and daughter</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/08/lingui-review-sacred-bonds-chadian-film-maker-mahamat-saleh-haroun</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fierce stabs of sexuality and violence cut through the stoic calm of Chadian film-maker Mahamat-Saleh Haroun’s urgent drama of survival&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahamat-Saleh Haroun is the Chadian film-maker whose &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/nov/22/artsfeatures5"&gt;2002 movie Abouna&lt;/a&gt; – my favourite of his – has a claim to classic status. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/25/mahamat-saleh-haroun-chad-film"&gt;Now he returns&lt;/a&gt; with a film that is recognisably a part of African cinema’s quietist walking-pace tradition, set in a place where, on its outskirts, the city becomes a village. The two distant ambient sounds are barnyard chickens and incessant traffic noise. Yet for all its ostensible gentleness, his storytelling is driven by a need to challenge the country’s reactionary theocratic males. There are fierce and even shocking stabs of sexuality and violence cutting through the opaque, stoic calm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The title Lingui is the Chadian word meaning sacred bonds, and on the question of abortion, the male rulers of church and state think the really sacred bond is between mother and unborn child, or perhaps more pertinently, between submissive women and autocratic menfolk. But the men’s opposition to abortion co-exists with an enormous enthusiasm for female genital mutilation. The film shows that they are two halves of a whole, and the women involved feel that their sacred bonds are those of loyalty to each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/08/lingui-review-sacred-bonds-chadian-film-maker-mahamat-saleh-haroun"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Jackass Forever review – unstoppable comedy stunt show still has a sting in its tail</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/02/jackass-forever-review-unstoppable-comedy-stunt-show-still-has-a-sting-in-its-tail</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The gang are back with more fantastically pointless and bad-taste feats involving bears, bulls, scorpions and spiders&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty years on, after innumerable TV series and spin-offs, lawsuits and movie franchise iterations the Jackass crew is back with yet another festival of fantastically pointless and immature bad taste, including a new younger generation of Jackass stuntsters who tell the camera they can’t believe they’re on the show they grew up with. The last film was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/04/jackass-3d-film-review"&gt;Jackass 3D in 2010&lt;/a&gt;, part of the 3D craze in cinema which has now been quietly abandoned without anyone noticing or caring. But Jackass marches on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As ever, the guys are taking turns doing stupid and dangerous things, while the rest of the gang scream with supportive, incredulous laughter and the participants scream with laughter right back at them once the stunt is over. In fact, the real Jackass gonzo discipline would seem to be keeping up the grinning party mood even after a heavyweight boxer has hit you in the balls. Are there any cutting-room-floor-moments when any of them seriously lost their sense of humour?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/02/jackass-forever-review-unstoppable-comedy-stunt-show-still-has-a-sting-in-its-tail"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Eyes of Tammy Faye review – Jessica Chastain is outrageously entertaining in Christian biopic</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/01/the-eyes-of-tammy-faye-review-jessica-chastain-is-outrageously-entertaining-in-christian-biopic</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The actor is hilarious in a very enjoyable look at the rise and fall of the televangelist’s life with slippery husband Jim Bakker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of her life, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jul/24/guardianobituaries.usa"&gt;Christian broadcaster and recording star Tammy Faye Bakker&lt;/a&gt;, wife of disgraced televangelist and fraudster Jim Bakker, achieved a kind of camp redemption in an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eyes_of_Tammy_Faye_(2000_film)"&gt;archly celebratory documentary&lt;/a&gt; released in 2000 called The Eyes of Tammy Faye, narrated by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/rupaul"&gt;RuPaul&lt;/a&gt;. She was praised for her courage in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/sep/18/tammy-faye-bakker-film-jessica-chastain"&gt;supporting the LGBT community and people with Aids in the 80s&lt;/a&gt;, defying the homophobia of the Christian right in Ronald Reagan’s America. The film suggested a kind of martyrdom for Tammy Faye, drawn into her husband’s mess. The title was about her permanent eyeliner and liquid mascara but with a cheeky hint that like Laura Mars in the famous horror movie, she saw things that involved her – sure – but for which she couldn’t be held responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The documentary has now been turned into a feature film starring &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/jessica-chastain"&gt;Jessica Chastain&lt;/a&gt; who gives a hilarious turn as Tammy Faye: like Tammy Wynette with a bit of Nancy Reagan and Eva Perón. She is a devoutly Christian young woman who falls in love at bible college with the charming but slippery Jim, excellently played by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/05/andrew-garfield-i-dont-think-i-present-as-goody-goody"&gt;Andrew Garfield&lt;/a&gt;. Creepy Jimmy has a free-and-easy way with other believers’ money and he ruthlessly gouges his TV flock for donations with which he builds up a Christian entertainment empire and lavish personal lifestyle. He fathers two children with Tammy Faye, but is reluctant to “snuggle” with her, preferring to blow off steam by rough-housing with his male assistant. The film also persuasively suggests that the famous TV preacher Rev Jerry Falwell (Vincent D’Onofrio) deliberately fanned the flames of the media scandal which brought the Bakkers down, so that he could step in and take over their media empire.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/01/the-eyes-of-tammy-faye-review-jessica-chastain-is-outrageously-entertaining-in-christian-biopic"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Jules et Jim review – Truffaut’s love triangle is a whirlwind masterpiece</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/02/jules-et-jim-review-truffauts-love-triangle-is-a-whirlwind-masterpiece</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The French New Wave classic chronicles the lives of two men and the dangerous object of their affections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;François Truffaut’s Jules et Jim from 1962 is the love triangle that feels like it’s happening in the swinging 60s present moment, like Godard’s triple-header Bande à Part. Actually, it’s set before and after the first world war, and the three principals finally reunite by bumping into each other at a Paris cinema showing a newsreel about the Nazis’ book-burning. (It’s based on a novel by Henri-Pierre Roché, who wrote another love-triangle story, Les Deux Anglaises et le Continent, which &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/19/francois-truffaut-retrospective-bfi-film"&gt;Truffaut&lt;/a&gt; filmed as Two English Girls in 1971.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appropriately for this film’s internationalist ethos, neither male hero has a homeland-appropriate name. Oskar Werner is Jules, a diffident young Austrian living in 1912 Paris: scholar, translator and Francophile. He befriends the rather more worldly Frenchman Jim, the journalist and would-be author played by Henri Serre. They are instantly as thick as thieves, a couple of jaunty swells and elegant flâneurs, devoted to art and avowedly uninterested in money – though each, apparently, has some modest private income. They drink in cafes, discuss poetry, box together at the gym and in a rather desultory way pursue women, including the madcap Thérèse (played by Truffaut stalwart Marie Dubois) who has a party trick of puffing a cigarette from the wrong end like a steam train.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/02/jules-et-jim-review-truffauts-love-triangle-is-a-whirlwind-masterpiece"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Belle review – anime that makes for an intriguing big-screen spectacle</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/01/belle-review-anime-that-makes-for-an-intriguing-big-screen-spectacle</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This weird postmodern drama sees a lonely teenager join a virtual world where she becomes a hugely successful singer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s some amazing big-screen spectacle in this weird postmodern emo photo-love drama from Japanese anime director Mamoru Hosoda, whose &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/02/mirai-review-mamoru-hosoda"&gt;previous film Mirai&lt;/a&gt; elevated him to auteur status. Suzu, voiced by Kaho Nakamura, is a deeply unhappy and lonely teenager at high school, who lives with her dad. Her mum died some years ago, attempting (successfully) to save a child from drowning and Suzu can’t come to terms with the zero-sum pointlessness of this calamity: a total stranger was saved but her mother died. Or not zero in fact: while her loss increased the sum-total of unhappiness, the most popular boy in school – a friend since they were little – is tender and protective towards Suzu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her life is complicated further when she is persuaded to join a virtual reality meta-universe called U, a glittering unearthly city like a next-level Manhattan or Shibuya. (Presumably entry into this fantasy world needs a VR headset, although oddly this is not made plain.) Participants have their biometrics read and get an enhanced avatar of themselves and Suzu finds that she is now “Belle”, an ethereally beautiful young woman with quirky freckles and a wonderful singing voice. To her astonishment, Suzu finds that Belle is becoming a colossally famous singer – but at the very high point of this meta-success she comes across the Beast, who disrupts one of her concerts: a brutish, aggressive outcast figure loathed by the self-appointed vigilante guardians of U.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/01/belle-review-anime-that-makes-for-an-intriguing-big-screen-spectacle"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Jockey review – intense racing movie about an ageing rider with one last shot at glory</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/01/jockey-review-a-sentimental-movie-that-trots-a-well-trod-narrative</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Clifton Collins Jr steps out of the minor-roles shadow with a terrific performance as the jockey battling the effects of racing on his health and fitness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘How many times have you broken your back?” A concerned-looking doctor is asking a jockey. It takes him a few seconds to count. “Three … I think.” The doctor, it turns out, is a vet; the jockey, who’s in his 40s, hasn’t got the cash for medical treatment so slips the racetrack vet a few dollars for an X-ray. It’s a scene typical of this macho-sentimental feature debut from Clint Bentley, which trots a well-trod narrative: the past-his-peak athlete clutching at one last chance of glory before the knacker’s yard. It’s a movie that gets by (and then some) on an intense and focused performance by character actor Clifton Collins Jr, and a truthful-feeling sense of place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collins plays the jockey: Jackson Silva is solid and decent, a man of few words and well-respected on the circuit. Racing has taken its toll on his body: he’s numb down one side and has got the shakes in his crop holding hand. Still, Jackson is convinced he’s got a couple of years left in him. He’s worked for some time with trainer Ruth (a warm and generous performance by Molly Parker), who has just bought an exceptional young thoroughbred. Another movie would have required a romance between Jackson and Ruth; but here the pair only have eyes for their horse. (“She’s like a swan with teeth,” Jackson marvels).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/01/jockey-review-a-sentimental-movie-that-trots-a-well-trod-narrative"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>A Violent Man review – hardnut prison drama is guilty as charged</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/01/a-violent-man-review-craig-fairbrass</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Craig Fairbrass’s impressive screen presence as a longtime convict carries this shadowy take on life behind bars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Craig Fairbrass (Villain, Muscle, Rise of the Footsoldier franchise) is an actor who may lack range but has an undeniable screen presence. He emits an almost radioactive glow with his hulking, &lt;em&gt;jolie-laide&lt;/em&gt; physiognomy, amplified by an abraded, East End baritone that seldom rises above a menacing whisper. That charisma goes a long way in this prison drama, written and directed by Ross McCall, which consists of a weary procession of scenes in which Fairbrass’s longtime convict Steve Mackelson growls, glowers and recites monologues full of self-serious pauses about prison life and how hard he thinks he is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this seems to take place in one or two rooms in one of Her Majesty’s establishments where budget cuts appear to have deprived the cells of lightbulbs. A moderate amount of backlighting is supplied by a strip of window high in one black wall. No wonder the supporting officers (SOs) can never tell what’s going on. The deprivations also extend to the prisoners’ and support officers’ language, worn back to the stubs of self-expression so that they can only speak in prison slang (“tooled up”, “burner”, “peas” and the like) or the word “cunt”, which in this world is so ubiquitous it’s practically a pronoun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/01/a-violent-man-review-craig-fairbrass"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Glasshouse review – dreamy dystopian horror with a Picnic at Hanging Rock vibe</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/31/glasshouse-review-dreamy-dystopian-horror-with-a-picnic-at-hanging-rock-vibe</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A mother and her daughters hole up in a Victorian conservatory, hiding from a devastating pandemic that lays waste to human memory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shot in a Victorian hothouse in South Africa with a mixed cast of local actors and the odd imported Brit – including Jessica Alexander, soon be seen in Disney’s live-action The Little Mermaid – this tense dystopian horror-thriller feels geographically non-specific, almost as if it were taking place in some kind of dream world. That touch of hazy vagueness is just right for SA director and co-writer Kelsey Egan’s cracking feature debut (co-written with Emma Lungiswa De Wet) which imagines a family of survivors hiding out in the title’s botanical conservatory after a pandemic has ravaged most of the world’s population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The invisible threat here is an airborne virus called “the shred” which wipes out memories and leaves its victims in a bestial state, unable to remember even their own names. A matriarchal woman known only as Mother (Adrienne Pearce) guides her three female progeny – cautious Evie (Anja Taljaard), dreamy Bee (Alexander) and adolescent Daisy (Kitty Harris), alongside shred-infected brother Gabe (Brent Vermeulen) – by teaching them how to garden (they have to pollinate the plants themselves because the bees are all gone), to read, paint, and pass on the stories of the Before Times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/31/glasshouse-review-dreamy-dystopian-horror-with-a-picnic-at-hanging-rock-vibe"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>How comic genius Charlie Chaplin survived his hungry childhood</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/06/charlie-chaplin-comic-genius-survived-ragged-london-childhood</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A recently unearthed interview with an old friend recalls how the actor was looked after by a kindly ‘foster mother’ who made sure he did the right thing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extreme poverty endured by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/18/the-real-charlie-chaplin-documentary-review" title=""&gt;Charlie Chaplin &lt;/a&gt;while growing up in the slums of Victorian London reduced him to stealing and being scolded by the woman who took care of him, according to an interview with one of his childhood friends that has remained unheard in the British Film Institute for almost 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effie Wisdom, whose aunt gave him a home from home when he needed it most, lamented that Chaplin “had a terrible life” as a child, “always hungry”, dressed in “ragged”, filthy clothes – no doubt later inspiring &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2021/aug/25/charlie-chaplin-archives-book" title=""&gt;the comic genius who created the Tramp&lt;/a&gt;, society’s eternal victim and one of cinema’s most memorable characters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/06/charlie-chaplin-comic-genius-survived-ragged-london-childhood"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>UK film and TV industry bounces back from Covid with record £5.6bn spend</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/04/uk-film-and-tv-industry-bounces-back-from-covid-with-record-spend</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Annual investment doubles as production industry races to replenish libraries depleted by the pandemic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK film and TV industry has bounced back spectacularly from the pandemic with a record £5.6bn spent making blockbusters such as Mission: Impossible 7 and big-budget dramas including Bridgerton in the UK last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/feb/04/money-spent-on-film-and-tv-production-in-uk-down-21-in-2020"&gt;double&lt;/a&gt; the level of investment in 2020, when the spread of coronavirus &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/16/filming-of-bbc-peaky-blinders-and-line-of-duty-postponed-coronavirus"&gt;shut down the production industry&lt;/a&gt; for months on end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/04/uk-film-and-tv-industry-bounces-back-from-covid-with-record-spend"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Dune and The Power of the Dog lead Bafta nominations as awards move on from Noel Clarke</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sci-fi blockbuster has 11 nominations and Jane Campion western starring Benedict Cumberbatch has eight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/03/bafta-awards-2022-the-full-list-of-nominations"&gt;Baftas 2022: the full list of nominations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;After last year’s event was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/apr/30/how-bafta-spent-two-weeks-grappling-with-noel-clarke-dilemma"&gt;overshadowed by the controversy surrounding Noel Clarke&lt;/a&gt;, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (&lt;a href="https://www.bafta.org/"&gt;Bafta&lt;/a&gt;) are hoping that it can regain credibility with its 2022 edition, for which the nominations have been announced. Science-fiction blockbuster Dune leads the way with 11 nominations, while the Jane Campion-directed western The Power of the Dog follows with eight, and Kenneth Branagh’s autobiographical drama &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/oct/12/belfast-review-kenneth-branagh-jamie-dornan-judi-dench"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt; has six.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, Clarke had been given Bafta’s outstanding contribution to British cinema award, but shortly afterwards &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/apr/29/actor-noel-clarke-accused-of-groping-harassment-and-bullying-by-20-women"&gt;the Guardian revealed 20 women had made allegations of harassment and bullying against him&lt;/a&gt;, and the award was suspended. (Clarke denies sexual misconduct.) Bafta subsequently announced that it &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2022/01/bafta-pauses-honorary-film-awards-2022-noel-clarke-controversy-1234918399/"&gt;would not hand out honorary awards&lt;/a&gt; until after a review had been conducted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/03/dune-and-the-power-of-the-dog-lead-baftas-as-awards-move-on-from-noel-clarke"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Have we witnessed the death of the Hollywood remake?</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/20/west-side-story-hollywood-remake-spielberg</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Meagre turnout for West Side Story shows that these days, the way to cash in on intellectual property is via sequels and reboots&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story hasn’t had audiences pirouetting and finger-clicking their way to cinemas. There are plenty of reasons why; the main one relating to a certain global pandemic. But one explanation that keeps being proffered is that viewers are simply sick of remakes – and it’s not entirely wrong. Hollywood still has no qualms about bringing back its vintage franchises, of course. But as the imminent returns of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/sep/09/the-matrix-resurrections-trailer-neo"&gt;The Matrix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/oct/12/scream-returns-first-trailer-slasher-neve-campbell-courteney-cox"&gt;Scream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/18/tom-cruise-top-gun-maverick-trailer"&gt;Top Gun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/oct/22/next-indiana-jones-harrison-ford-movie-time-travel-week-in-geek"&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/a&gt;, Hocus Pocus and Legally Blonde demonstrate, the fashionable way to cash in on a venerable intellectual property is to hire as many of the original cast members as you can and to pick up where you left off. Sequels are in; remakes are out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remakes, lest we forget, were once central to the cinematic landscape – hardly more remarkable or disreputable than a new theatrical production of an old play. When The Maltese Falcon came out in 1940, it was the third adaptation of the same book within a decade. Some Like It Hot? Pinched from a 1951 German farce, which was in turn pinched from a 1935 French one. Hitchcock’s 1956 classic &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/17/favourite-hitchcock-film-man-who-knew-too-much"&gt;The Man Who Knew Too Much&lt;/a&gt;? A total rip-off of Hitchcock’s 1934 classic, The Man Who Knew Too Much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/20/west-side-story-hollywood-remake-spielberg"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Actor’s phone is turned over to authorities investigating fatal shooting on New Mexico film set in October&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alec Baldwin has handed over his cellphone to investigators who are looking into the fatal shooting on the New Mexico set of the film Rust in October, his attorney and a law enforcement official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A search warrant for Baldwin’s iPhone was issued in December. The sheriff’s office for Santa Fe County, New Mexico, had said earlier this week that it was still trying to obtain the device from the 30 Rock actor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/15/alec-baldwin-hands-over-phone-in-film-shooting-investigation"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>My award goes to... our film critics reveal their personal Oscars shortlists</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/06/the-observers-alternative-oscars-shortlists-nominees-2022</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the official Academy nominations on Tuesday, Observer film critics pick their own favourites&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid the hype over her acclaimed performance as Diana, Princess of Wales in &lt;em&gt;Spencer&lt;/em&gt;, Kristen Stewart briefly stopped awards pundits dead in their tracks when, upon being asked about her Oscar buzz, she drily admitted, “I don’t give a shit.” Sacrilege! Some of the best films and performances of all time haven’t been considered by the Academy, she continued. “There’s five spots. What the fuck are you going to do?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody disagrees with Stewart on any of this: just ask our critics, whose ideal Oscar ballots below are knowingly far from the expected reality of next week’s nominations. That the actor’s comments made showbiz headlines anyway speaks to the strange aura the Oscars maintain as a gold standard of cinematic achievement: for several months a year, people fret and discuss and strategise about them, while companies expensively campaign for them, only to spend the rest of the year complaining that they don’t mean anything anyway. Even Stewart’s scepticism emerged while on the campaign trail, being interviewed on &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/kristen-stewart-spencer/id1536666553?i=1000542373154"&gt;a &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/kristen-stewart-spencer/id1536666553?i=1000542373154"&gt;Variety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/kristen-stewart-spencer/id1536666553?i=1000542373154"&gt; podcast named &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/kristen-stewart-spencer/id1536666553?i=1000542373154"&gt;Awards Circuit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Should she win for &lt;em&gt;Spencer&lt;/em&gt;, she’ll doubtless turn up and give a humbly grateful speech anyway. That’s the game. Nobody gives a shit about the Oscars, after all, except when everyone does. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here, then, are our critics’ picks of who and what should be on those Oscars shortlists. &lt;strong&gt;Guy Lodge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PETITE MAMAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summer of Soul&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Green Knight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Titane&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Censor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/06/the-observers-alternative-oscars-shortlists-nominees-2022"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>François Truffaut’s 20 best films – ranked</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/03/francois-truffaut-20-best-films-ranked</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As Jules et Jim gets a re-release in time for the 90th anniversary on Sunday of the French director’s birth, we pan across his greatest works&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This worldly comedy of love is an example of how Truffaut always aspired to something lighthearted with &lt;a href="https://thedissolve.com/features/movie-of-the-week/233-ernst-lubitschs-charming-pre-code-transgressions/"&gt;even a touch of Lubitschian comedy&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s a very 70s piece of work in its knowing and slightly louche celebration of male romantic conquest (it got a Hollywood remake directed by Blake Edwards with Burt Reynolds). Charles Denner plays Bertrand, a guy who loves all women with the passion of a connoisseur or a collector; at his funeral, the service is thronged with his female admirers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/03/francois-truffaut-20-best-films-ranked"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>From age-gap romances to a homemade Welsh robot: the best of Sundance 2022</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/29/sundance-film-festival-2022-roundup-review</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Noomi Rapace as a Macedonian witch vies with Cooper Raiff’s latest gem and dapper Bill Nighy in this second virtual edition of the US indie festival&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The uncertainties of the pandemic might have skewered plans to host a hybrid festival – it was originally hoped to combine an in-person event in Park City, Utah with an online option – but certain Sundance truths remain inviolable. Key among them is the fact that even without the heady effect of all that mountain air, and despite a selection &lt;a href="https://festival.sundance.org/"&gt;this year&lt;/a&gt; that is unlikely to go down as one for the ages, Sundance buzz remains a powerful force with the potential to propel a small film to big results. This year, however, there is little that has combined crowd-pleasing credentials with critical consensus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the main contender for crossover success is &lt;strong&gt;Cha Cha Real Smooth&lt;/strong&gt;, the second film from American Gen Z wunderkind Cooper Raiff (&lt;em&gt;Shithouse&lt;/em&gt;), who wrote, directed and stars in a sweet, funny and almost painfully earnest drama about a directionless 22-year-old college leaver (an endearingly puppyish Raiff) who falls hard for Dakota Johnson’s thirtysomething divorcee with an autistic daughter. On paper, it’s an archetypal Sundance movie – emotionally engaging, honest, with just a hint of grit – but my gut says that some slightly sniffy reviews have misjudged the broad appeal of this one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/29/sundance-film-festival-2022-roundup-review"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Willem Dafoe’s 20 best films – ranked!</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/20/willem-dafoe-20-best-films-ranked</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As his new film Nightmare Alley hits cinemas, the possessor of Hollywood’s most piercing stare gets the ranked treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dafoe wasn’t natural casting as the clerkly TS Eliot in this literary biopic, which chronicled the poet’s troubled first marriage – and it showed, despite his customary actorly intelligence. If nothing else, it proved that, his highbrow credentials notwithstanding, Dafoe wasn’t really cut out for the anglophile heritage pics that littered the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/20/willem-dafoe-20-best-films-ranked"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>From whodunnits to cerebral sci-fi: what movie trends will 2022 bring?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The year promises murder mysteries, slashers and fan service sequels hoping to tempt audiences back to the big screen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now arguably more than ever, it’s hard to predict what will and won’t connect with cinemagoers over the next 12 months, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/06/is-hollywood-heading-for-another-problem-year-at-the-box-office"&gt;a tumultuous time of uncertainty&lt;/a&gt; extending until an unknowable date. While the rough release schedule is more than certain to change (a number of January releases have already moved as a result of Omicron), what it does do is show us what the industry is banking on right now, outside of the bread-and-butter business of superheroes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at what you’ll be seeing the most of in 2022:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/13/2022-movie-trends-whodunnits-cerebral-sci-fi"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Bruce Willis films – ranked!</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/06/bruce-willis-films-ranked</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the actor starring in not one but two iffy thrillers out this month, we take a look over the more successful end of his long, action-packed career&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This futuristic thriller about “surries” – artificial doubles who do the dirty work while their owners stay home – could have had heaps more fun riffing on the disparity between the grizzled older Willis and his blond synthetic doppelganger. Still, it is nice to see him bristling with Rosamund Pike, who plays his glassy wife, and being reunited briefly with his Pulp Fiction nemesis Ving Rhames.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/06/bruce-willis-films-ranked"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Ye, Diana and TikTok: the top documentaries to watch in 2022</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/05/documentaries-to-watch-2022</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year’s most anticipated docs include a project on the rapper 20-plus years in the making and a film on a pre-Roe underground abortion network&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jan/06/top-documentaries-2021-rihanna-nazi-hunting-tiger-woods"&gt;years past&lt;/a&gt;, 2022 promises a trove of documentaries – some still on delayed releases due to the pandemic – about the world’s biggest celebrities, scandals and contemporary forces (namely: TikTok). The coming year will see the unveiling of a Kanye West project 20-plus years in the making, an investigation into the aftermath of two Boeing aircraft due to design flaws, Amy Poehler’s documentary debut on Lucille Ball, and perhaps the premiere of the long-gestating and still-unnamed Rihanna film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more sure to be announced in the coming months, here are some of the most anticipated documentaries of 2022:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/05/documentaries-to-watch-2022"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Netflix’s 2022 preview trailer is a ghoulish nightmare of coerced A-listers | Stuart Heritage</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/03/netflix-2022-preview-trailer-montage</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The streamer’s frenzied look at the year ahead breaks the fourth wall mid-scenes to turn major stars into reticent marketing tools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worst part of anything film-related is the context-free montage. The worst part of going to the cinema is being pummelled with a context-free montage of upcoming attractions before the movie starts. The worst part of watching awards shows is being pummelled with context-free montages of all the films that were released in the previous 12 months. A context-free montage is less than a trailer. It isn’t even an advert. It’s a sizzle reel that reveals nothing about anything. There is no information. It’s the movie equivalent of sitting in front of the washing machine as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Netflix prides itself on being a bold new disruptor in the movie industry, so it only makes sense that it should also boldly disrupt the context-free montage genre. Behold, Netflix’s new 2022 movie preview video, where the montage talks to you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/03/netflix-2022-preview-trailer-montage"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Baftas 2022: a lively, good-taste nomination list despite some surprising omissions | Peter Bradshaw</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/03/baftas-2022-a-lively-good-taste-nomination-list-despite-some-surprising-omissions</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A diverse set of contenders and panoply of worthy potential winners mean 2022’s ceremony can get the Baftas back on track&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/03/bafta-awards-2022-the-full-list-of-nominations"&gt;Baftas 2022: the full list of nominations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/03/dune-and-the-power-of-the-dog-lead-baftas-as-awards-move-on-from-noel-clarke"&gt;Dune and The Power of the Dog lead Baftas as awards move on from Noel Clarke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bafta must hope that its nominations mark a fresh start after a year of pure mortification for that body caused by the Noel Clarke debacle: screenwriter-actor-director Clarke was presented in 2021 with the outstanding contribution to cinema award, despite accusations against him of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/apr/29/actor-noel-clarke-accused-of-groping-harassment-and-bullying-by-20-women"&gt;bullying and abuse&lt;/a&gt;. Clarke denied accusations of sexual misconduct and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/apr/30/how-bafta-spent-two-weeks-grappling-with-noel-clarke-dilemma"&gt;the award finally had to be suspended&lt;/a&gt;. But this year’s list is very lively: the best director section is not lacking in inclusivity and good taste: Aleem Khan, Ryûsuke Hamaguchi, Audrey Diwan, Paul Thomas Anderson, Jane Campion and Julia Ducournau. (All fascinating choices – though &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/14/titane-review-julia-ducournau"&gt;I personally am a Titane refusenik&lt;/a&gt;, finding that film inferior to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/21/raw-review-cannibalism-julia-ducournau-arthouse-horror"&gt;Ducournau’s debut, Raw&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading the nominations tally is Denis Villeneuve’s gigantic sci-fi adaptation &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/oct/20/dune-review-denis-villeneuves-awe-inspiring-epic-is-a-moment-of-triumph"&gt;Dune&lt;/a&gt; with 11 (though no director nod), then it’s Jane Campion’s enthralling &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/17/the-power-of-the-dog-review-jane-campions-superb-gothic-western-is-mysterious-and-menacing"&gt;The Power of the Dog&lt;/a&gt; with eight, and below that is Kenneth Branagh’s wonderfully heartfelt and sympathetic personal movie &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/oct/12/belfast-review-kenneth-branagh-jamie-dornan-judi-dench"&gt;Belfast&lt;/a&gt; with six, based on his own early memories of a boyhood in Northern Ireland at the beginning of the Troubles. I was surprised actually not to see Belfast going higher than this and not actually leading the field, as it seems tailor-made to appeal to Bafta voters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/03/baftas-2022-a-lively-good-taste-nomination-list-despite-some-surprising-omissions"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Peter Dinklage is right: a live-action Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a fundamentally awful idea</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/27/peter-dinklage-snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs-disablist-representation-disney</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I cannot see how Disney can remake its 1937 cartoon with live actors without falling into disablist stereotypes of people with dwarfism &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a professional actor living with dwarfism, all I could do when I read &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/25/peter-dinklage-disney-remake-snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs"&gt;Peter Dinklage’s critical comments&lt;/a&gt; about Disney’s forthcoming live-action remake of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was nod in agreement. Peter is a much more famous actor than I am, but my disability politics are very similar to his. I am very aware of the importance of representation, and of how few genuine and humanising representations there are of people with dwarfism on our screens and on our stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am so careful about the roles I pick because I know that, if I get it wrong, there will be repercussions for some innocent person with dwarfism just minding their own business. I don’t want what I create as an artist to be used to bring a random person down in the middle of their day. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/23/verne-troyer-mini-me-dwarfism-abuse-austin-powers"&gt;I had “Mini-Me” yelled at me by strangers for years after Austin Powers came out.&lt;/a&gt; “Hi-ho, hi-ho,” is regularly hummed or sung at me by passersby. I am filmed and photographed by strangers for who knows what on social media. Most insults are simply regurgitated rubbish that people have picked up from somewhere in the social repertoire of negative and dehumanising media portrayals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/27/peter-dinklage-snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs-disablist-representation-disney"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The British film industry is doomed if it can’t make room for new film-makers | Mike Newell</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/25/the-british-film-industry-is-doomed-if-it-cant-support-new-film-makers</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;New creative talents need to be able to take risks, says the director of Four Weddings – and for all the financial obstacles, there are things we can do to enable them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘A way in” – that’s the great phrase. The problem never goes away: the film world’s eternal problem is, as ever, trying to achieve diversity while not being run down by the commercial demands of whatever version of film power is in command at any one moment. The world has changed, Netflix and other streaming services are dominant, but in the end things don’t change if “the money” (whoever it is) don’t feel that a project is as fully commercial as it might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercialism is always the first yardstick, which when it works is fair enough – and so it should be, no one is asking for a soft ride. But sometimes that means a film-maker will be asked to make something they don’t recognise, something which isn’t what was intended and has been misread. Getting a project perceived for what it is is always problematic. Oddly enough, reading has become a problem in the film industry: people just don’t like doing it and it is a bore. But at some point someone will have put their energy behind 90-100 pages of script – at which point, people have opinions and notes. While some professional script people are good at it, especially in TV, in the movies it’s seen as the junior’s way in, and it may be that the junior needs more experience. Then there’s the question of actors and what makes it commercial for the people who are going to give you the money. A tremendous amount of the energy goes into getting the money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/25/the-british-film-industry-is-doomed-if-it-cant-support-new-film-makers"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Jean-Jacques Beineix: the French auteur who brought style and substance</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/14/jean-jacques-beineix-the-french-auteur-who-brought-style-and-substance</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The director of Diva and Betty Blue was often labelled all flash and nothing else but his finest work showed far much more &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Margaret Thatcher’s reign in the 1980s, British cinema was largely downbeat, caustic, political and oppositionist. But over the Channel in François Mitterrand’s France, the movies were glitzy and flashy, with a sexy if superficial neon sheen: the so-called &lt;em&gt;cinéma du look&lt;/em&gt;. No director was more responsible for this than Jean-Jacques Beineix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He became both famed and mocked for that colossal 1986 hit which launched the smouldering career of its star Beatrice Dalle: Betty Blue, a steamy drama in which an aspiring writer embarks on a passionate, destructive affair with Dalle’s impetuous siren, Betty. It was nominated for best foreign film at the Oscars, the Globes and the Baftas and got nine César nominations. But Betty Blue actually won just one César: the horribly appropriate award for best poster (an award discontinued a few years afterwards), the iconic image of the young Dalle looming beautifully up in the blue of deepening sunset-sky with the beach shack starkly picked out down below on a glowing horizon. It was a poster that adorned a million student bedroom walls and soon the movie, and Beineix himself, came to be looked down on as a callow 1980s taste: the legwarmers of French cinema.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/14/jean-jacques-beineix-the-french-auteur-who-brought-style-and-substance"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Sidney Poitier was the only light at the end of the tunnel’: Don Warrington on his lifelong hero</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/13/sidney-poitier-don-warrington-actor-death-in-paradise</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Trinidadian-British stage actor – and star of Death in Paradise and Rising Damp – pays tribute to a Black Hollywood pioneer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was in my late 30s, someone came up to me in the street and started talking to me as if I were Sidney Poitier. To the extent that they called me “Sidney”. I said: “I’m sorry – my name is Don.” And they looked at me and said: “Oh Sidney, when did you change your name?” They simply would not accept I was somebody else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you didn’t model yourself after Poitier, other people would. He was just the go-to reference. I’ve yet to meet a Black actor who hasn’t been compared to him – which is both irritating and enjoyable. And says more about the one making the comparison.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/13/sidney-poitier-don-warrington-actor-death-in-paradise"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Why don’t Jews play Jews?’ – David Baddiel on the row over Helen Mirren as Golda Meir</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/12/helen-mirren-golda-meir-maureen-lipman-david-baddiel-row-jews-bojack-horseman</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maureen Lipman sparked fury by suggesting the ex Israeli PM should not be played by Mirren. But, says David Baddiel, why shouldn’t ‘authentic casting’ apply to all minorities? And where is the outcry over Bojack Horseman?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after the brilliant It’s A Sin came out, Russell T Davies justified his decision to cast only gay actors in gay parts by &lt;a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/drama/its-a-sin-gay-casting/"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt;: “They are not there to ‘act gay’ because ‘acting gay’ is a bunch of codes for a performance. You wouldn’t cast someone able-bodied and put them in a wheelchair … authenticity is leading us to joyous places.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be wrong to suggest that no one questioned this statement, but it became part of an ongoing conversation about casting and minorities. Davies was not, thankfully, mightily abused on social media for saying it – which is what happened last week to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/05/maureen-lipman-attacks-casting-of-helen-mirren-as-former-israeli-pm"&gt;Maureen Lipman, after she suggested&lt;/a&gt;, on being asked about the casting of Helen Mirren in a biopic of Israel’s former prime minister Golda Meir, that Jewish parts should perhaps be played by Jewish actors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/12/helen-mirren-golda-meir-maureen-lipman-david-baddiel-row-jews-bojack-horseman"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Sidney Poitier was a defining figure of distinguished Blackness | Todd Boyd</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/11/sidney-poitier-defining-figure-distinguished-blackness</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At a time when Black actors were forced into submissive or inarticulate roles, the actor showed strength moving through hostile white spaces with dignity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon the announcement of Hollywood legend Sidney Poitier’s death, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrToddBoyd/status/1479554639108325376"&gt;I sent out a tweet&lt;/a&gt; that featured my favorite photo of him. The photo in question shows a shirtless Poitier, wearing dark sunglasses like Miles Davis on the cover of ’Round About Midnight, playing the saxophone alongside jazz man Sonny Stitt, while standing in the street, surrounded by a community of appreciative onlookers, otherwise known as “the people”. The reason I dig this photo so much is because it offers a more complex image of Poitier than the one that had come to define him at the height of his fame in Hollywood. I have never been able to confirm the context of this photo, but I have always assumed that it was taken while he was preparing for his role as the expatriate horn player in the film Paris Blues. Whatever the circumstances, though, the image itself suggests an authenticity, a certain street credibility that is much more complex than the conveniently integrationist symbolism that his persona has so often been reduced to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the late 1960s Sidney Poitier was the biggest box office draw in America. With movies like In the Heat of the Night, To Sir With Love and Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, his films had become their own genre. Accomplishing this was no small feat. When Poitier began his career, most movies featuring predominantly Black casts were musicals. Black men who appeared in otherwise all-white films tended to be represented as inarticulate, child-like buffoons; racial clowns who scratched when they didn’t itch and laughed when nothing was funny. Poitier’s rise to the top of the Hollywood mountain changed this. He was often the lone Black person moving through hostile white spaces. His refined, erudite and dignified image was a counter to the coonery and buffoonery that figures like Stepin’ Fetchit, Mantan Moreland, Eddie “Rochester” Anderson, and Willie Best had previously represented. Like so many elite mid-century jazz musicians, Poitier wanted people to see him as an artist, not as a stereotypical entertainer. And in this he succeeded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/11/sidney-poitier-defining-figure-distinguished-blackness"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Power of the Dog among worthy winners as disgraced Golden Globes plays it safe</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/10/the-power-of-the-dog-among-worthy-winners-as-disgraced-golden-globes-plays-it-safe</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jane Campion’s colossal western and Steven Spielberg’s passionate West Side Story revival head up a list that snubs more transgressive offerings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/10/golden-globes-the-power-of-the-dog-and-succession-win-at-celebrity-free-ceremony"&gt;The Power of the Dog and Succession win at celebrity-free ceremony&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/05/golden-globes-2022-will-have-no-stars-red-carpet-or-tv-show"&gt;much-disgraced Golden Globes&lt;/a&gt;, derided for a lack of diversity and transparency in the voting membership, lucrative TV coverage cancelled, gravy-train derailed and the awards ceremony dwindled to a virtual event on social media, carries paradoxically on with delivering a set of awards that are in perfectly plausible good taste and not very much different from all the other un-disgraced awards ceremonies. However, it was sad to see Paul Thomas Anderson’s dazzling comedy of transgression &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/15/licorice-pizza-review-paul-thomas-anderson"&gt;Licorice Pizza&lt;/a&gt; overlooked, of which more in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jane Campion’s handsome, complex and brilliant western drama &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/17/the-power-of-the-dog-review-jane-campions-superb-gothic-western-is-mysterious-and-menacing"&gt;The Power of the Dog&lt;/a&gt; gets best picture (drama) and best director, along with best supporting actor for the excellent Kodi Smit-McPhee, while Steven Spielberg’s glorious, passionately respectful revival of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/02/west-side-story-review-steven-spielberg"&gt;West Side Story&lt;/a&gt; wins best picture in the musical or comedy section, along with its breakout player Ariana DeBose for best supporting actress and newcomer Rachel Zegler for best actress in musical/comedy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/10/the-power-of-the-dog-among-worthy-winners-as-disgraced-golden-globes-plays-it-safe"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Sidney Poitier: a natural film star who quietly pioneered a revolution</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/07/sidney-poitier-natural-film-star-remembrance-peter-bradshaw</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Poitier, who has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/07/sidney-poitier-in-the-heat-of-the-night-acting-pioneer-dies"&gt;died aged 94&lt;/a&gt;, came to fame via a trio of movie roles defined by race and racial difference&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For postwar America, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/07/sidney-poitier-in-the-heat-of-the-night-acting-pioneer-dies"&gt;Sidney Poitier&lt;/a&gt; became something like the Black Cary Grant: a strikingly handsome and well-spoken Bahamian-American actor. He was a natural film star who projected passion, yet tempered by a kind of refinement and restraint that white moviegoers found very reassuring. Poitier was graceful, manly, self-possessed, with an innate dignity and a tremendous screen presence. He also had a beautiful, melodious voice – the result of his childhood spent in the Bahamas, and then struggling early years in New York, trying to make it as an actor and privately studying the voices of mellifluous white radio announcers. He was a traditional, classical actor in many ways, following in the footsteps of &lt;a href="http://www.biography.com/people/paul-robeson-9460451"&gt;Paul Robeson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.blackpast.org/aah/lee-canada-1907-1952"&gt;Canada Lee&lt;/a&gt;, but eminently castable in a new generation of modern roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all his famous movie roles are defined by race and racial difference, particularly that extraordinary trio of movies that came out in one year, 1967. In &lt;a href="http://www.british60scinema.net/book-to-film-adaptations-in-the-1960s/to-sir-with-love/"&gt;To Sir With Love&lt;/a&gt;, he was the visiting Black teacher in swinging London who gets through to the kids by challenging them to be adults. In &lt;a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/guess-whos-coming-to-dinner-1968"&gt;Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner&lt;/a&gt; he is the Black man who wants to marry a young white woman, in an America where this was still illegal in many southern states. (This proposal causes excruciating discomfiture in his fiancee’s liberal parents, played by Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn.) And in &lt;a href="http://www.filmsite.org/inth.html"&gt;In the Heat of the Night&lt;/a&gt; he was the Black homicide detective forced to assist a bigoted white cop, played by Rod Steiger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/07/sidney-poitier-natural-film-star-remembrance-peter-bradshaw"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Peter Bogdanovich: a loving cineaste and fearless genius of cinema | Peter Bradshaw</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/06/peter-bogdanovich-a-loving-cineaste-and-fearless-genius-of-cinema</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The writer-director’s death at 82 leaves behind a legacy of impactful films, from The Last Picture Show to Mask, and also a deep love of the craft&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2022/jan/06/peter-bogdanovich-a-life-in-pictures"&gt;Peter Bogdanovich: a life in pictures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/06/peter-bogdanovich-dies-acclaimed-writer-director"&gt;Peter Bogdanovich, acclaimed writer-director, dies at 82&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Bogdanovich was the blazing night-sky comet of the New Hollywood generation whose trajectory got knocked off course a little, by personal tragedy and the contingencies of show business, but kept hurtling onwards with brilliant work and passionate cinephilia to the very end. His first four hits, Targets (1968), The Last Picture Show (1971), What’s Up Doc? (1972) and Paper Moon (1973) were somehow both thrillingly and authentically modern and yet also instantly belonged to the classic pantheon. With the touch of restless young genius, he seemed to reinvent pulp crime, the western, the road movie and the screwball comedy – in short order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember Bogdanovich in 2018, frail and unwell as he then reportedly was, dominating the Venice Film Festival with two important movies showing there: his superb documentary about Buster Keaton (whose reputation and importance he typically boosted for the 21st century) and his edited, “salvaged” account of Orson Welles’s lost, sprawling movie The Other Side Of The Wind, in which Bogdanovich himself starred, satirising the trauma of the Hollywood old guard in having the baton prised from their grasp by the young Turks. And Bogdanovich sat at Welles’s feet, the way Truffaut sat at Hitchcock’s, and perhaps consciously assumed the mantle of the sorcerer’s apprentice, although learned the way all Welles’s associates learned, how capricious and hurtful Welles could be. But in his later years, taking a creative comfort in well-crafted comedy in the classic Hollywood style, he found himself being supported and bankrolled by younger proteges like Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach who were as awestruck by Bogdanovich as he himself once was of John Ford and Howard Hawks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I myself met him only once, at a lunch in London’s Soho to launch his very good and underrated film The Cat’s Meow in 2004, about the mysterious true-crime “Hollywood Babylon” story about the death of a film mogul aboard WR Hearst’s yacht in 1924. He was elegant, smart – a great lover of London – and very funny on the subject of being recognised for his TV acting role as the therapist of Dr Jennifer Melfi in HBO’s The Sopranos and therefore the psychoanalytical grandfather of Tony Soprano himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Targets was a fascinatingly strange, experimental, underrated and misunderstood work which absorbed the defiant energy of countercultural cinema, with the pulp violence of Gun Crazy or In Cold Blood or Reservoir Dogs. In one plot strand, the horror icon Boris Karloff plays something like himself; in the other plot, a kid becomes obsessed with guns and creating some real horror. The simple association was elegant, ingenious, equal to the meta-horror playfulness that became fashionable 30 years later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/06/peter-bogdanovich-a-loving-cineaste-and-fearless-genius-of-cinema"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Romaine Hart: an inspiring figure who reinvigorated cinema in the UK | Stephen Woolley</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/03/romaine-hart-inspiring-figure-who-led-the-reinvigoration-of-cinema-culture-in-the-uk</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hart gave me my first break in the industry and stood out as a beacon of hope for those who followed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/03/romaine-hart-obituary"&gt;Romaine Hart obituary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romaine Hart gave me my start in the film business, hiring me as an usher at the Screen on the Green cinema in Islington, London, when I was 18; alongside the programmer Roger Austin she taught me fundamental lessons about cinema management that inspired me through the Other Cinema, Scala and later Palace years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a teenager I had witnessed the transformation of my local, the Rex cinema on Upper Street, a downmarket fleapit that was part of a declining chain owned by the Bloom family (Romaine’s maiden name), to the Screen on the Green, with its progressive and clever programming. It showed critically acclaimed, mainly US second-run classics by day (the first double bill I attended as a 15-year-old was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/22/the-graduate-review-anne-bancroft-dustin-hoffman"&gt;The Graduate&lt;/a&gt; and The Thomas Crown Affair). From 11.15pm the late-night cinema club showed cult films such as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/16/performance-i-still-dont-fully-understand-it-behind-the-scenes-photos-from-the-cult-classic"&gt;Performance&lt;/a&gt;, audacious double bills featuring &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/claude-chabrol"&gt;Chabrol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/akirakurosawa"&gt;Kurosawa&lt;/a&gt; and other greats of world cinema and obscure but daring fare like Henry Miller’s Quiet Days in Clichy. The Friday all-nighters of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jun/04/great-dynasties-marx-brothers"&gt;the Marx Brothers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/humphreybogart"&gt;Humphrey Bogart&lt;/a&gt; classics were usually packed to the rafters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/03/romaine-hart-inspiring-figure-who-led-the-reinvigoration-of-cinema-culture-in-the-uk"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘I’ve had letters from klansmen’: Jennifer Beals on Flashdance, The L Word and fighting to get diverse stories told</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/07/ive-had-letters-from-klansmen-jennifer-beals-on-flashdance-the-l-word-and-fighting-to-get-diverse-stories-told</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The actor, who broke through in 1983 playing a welder who dreamed of being a dancer, reflects on a life of activism, why gen Z give her hope and joining the Star Wars universe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Beals is talking to me by Zoom from … “Do I have to say?” she asks. Not really, I tell her. “I can tell you there’s a blizzard outside and it’s really beautiful.” Her reticence, which lasts about 30 seconds, is because she is in New York, filming a yet to be announced new season of Law &amp;amp; Order. You could imagine her taking a friend’s secret to the grave; she is very cagey about where she lives, tending to call herself “nomadic” and describing her home as “the middle of nowhere” (in reality, somewhere near Los Angeles). Commercial discretion, though? Not so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is creepy to go on about how young actors still look, as though that were a goal in itself, but Beals, 58, is so unchanged – since she first played Bette in The L Word in 2004; since Devil in a Blue Dress in 1995 – that my brain thinks it is making a mistake. She definitely, positively starred in Flashdance in 1983, her breakthrough role after a tiny part in My Bodyguard three years earlier, yet that can’t be right – it was 40 years ago! It is like walking past someone you think you knew at school, then realising that it can’t be them because this person is 21.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/07/ive-had-letters-from-klansmen-jennifer-beals-on-flashdance-the-l-word-and-fighting-to-get-diverse-stories-told"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Branagh and Hinds: two Belfast boys on childhood and the Troubles</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/06/kenneth-branagh-and-ciaran-hinds-belfast-boys-on-growing-up-across-the-divide</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The actors grew up in the same city on opposite sides of the Troubles. Here, they reflect on revisiting their past in Belfast, Branagh’s acclaimed, highly personal new film&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Troubles kicked off in Belfast in August 1969, Kenneth Branagh was eight years old. He recalls cowering under a table with his mother and his older brother as paving stones were torn from the street and hurled through the windows of their Catholic neighbours. Ciarán Hinds was away on holiday in the countryside, and only found out what was going on when his father, a doctor, phoned to say he wouldn’t be joining the family for his usual week, because he felt honour-bound to stay and tend to his patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Branagh was from working-class Protestant stock, while Hinds was a 16-year-old former altar boy from a Catholic family, whose school was close to the Branagh house. Though they never knew each other, they would have gone to the same cinema, hung out in the same park, and suffered the same Sunday doldrums. “Belfast Sunday evening, you know, was a grim time,” says Branagh. Even the kids’ playground in the park was shut, Hinds adds: “And not only was the playground locked, but each individual swing was too, and the roundabout was padlocked.” “It was savage, wasn’t it?” chips in Branagh. “Brutal, brutal!” sighs Hinds, shaking his head in mock disbelief.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/06/kenneth-branagh-and-ciaran-hinds-belfast-boys-on-growing-up-across-the-divide"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘I’ve had some hairy experiences’: actor Adeel Akhtar on racism, role models and feeling hopeful</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/feb/06/ive-had-some-hairy-experiences-actor-adeel-akhbar-on-racism-role-models-and-feeling-hopeful</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At 30, Adeel Akhtar was all but homeless, now he’s been nominated for this year’s Baftas. Here, he talks about the beauty of ordinary lives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adeel Akhtar was living in a van, wondering if he should move back in with his parents. It was 2010. He’d recently appeared in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/may/06/four-lions-review" title=""&gt;Four Lions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the Chris Morris satire, in which he plays a Muslim extremist who, in an uncanny set of events, blows himself up in a Yorkshire sheep field. The film had been successful. (The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; called it “stiletto sharp”.) But it did not immediately become the career tipping point Akhtar hoped it might. So there he was: 30 years old, not well off, suffering after the break-up of a “messy” relationship, recording audition tapes from his van. The work had dried up, but he wasn’t hustling. Even when he got a gig, he sometimes wouldn’t bother learning his lines. “What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; that?” he asks now. “Why would a person not apply themselves?” He shakes his head. “I don’t know. I suppose a not-nice way of looking at my younger self is that I was lazy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akhtar does not seem lazy now. A few days before we meet, in a mid-market café near his south London home, he won Best Actor at the British Independent Film Awards, for his role in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/11/ali-ava-review-clio-barnard" title=""&gt;Ali &amp;amp; Ava&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Clio Barnard film about forbidden love. Akhtar plays Ali, a British Asian man – irrepressible, distressed, permanently on the edge of euphoria or breakdown – who falls for an older white woman. The film is set in and around the housing estates of Bradford, and across social and racial divides. At the awards ceremony, Akhtar praised Barnard for presenting ordinary lives as extraordinary, and for “looking at people who are traditionally overlooked”. This was important, he said, particularly for him, because, “I’m one of them.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/feb/06/ive-had-some-hairy-experiences-actor-adeel-akhbar-on-racism-role-models-and-feeling-hopeful"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Sunday with Sadie Frost: ‘Sensory satisfaction is all at this stage in life’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/06/sunday-with-sadie-frost-i-painted-my-bedroom-pink</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The director on yoga, films, football – and spending lazy sons with her grownup children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What time are you up?&lt;/strong&gt; I’m usually awake by 6am, with my sausage dog’s nose pressed against me; we sleep arm-in-paw. I recently moved house and painted my bedroom pink with pictures of Marilyn Monroe on the walls, because I’m single so I can. I light the fire, incense and candles. Sensory satisfaction is all at this stage in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A morning routine? &lt;/strong&gt;After 15 mind-calming minutes of Vipassanā yogic meditation, awakening my kundalini, I feel cleansed and calmer. Things are still, if only briefly. Then I chuck on my tracksuit and take the dog to the park while it’s quiet out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/06/sunday-with-sadie-frost-i-painted-my-bedroom-pink"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘I wanted to be on the side of women’: Mahamat-Saleh Haroun on his abortion drama set in Chad</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/04/mahamat-saleh-haroun-abortion-drama-chad-achouackh-abakar-souleymane-lingui</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The famed director and lead actor Achouackh Abakar Souleymane talk about the challenges of making a female-led movie in Chad, and being overwhelmed by audience responses &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a young boy in Chad, Mahamat-Saleh Haroun grew up surrounded by women – mother, aunties, four sisters, one formidable grandmother. The day after he was beaten by a teacher at Koranic school, his grandmother marched up to give the man a piece of her mind: “My grandson will never come back to &lt;em&gt;your schoo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;l.&lt;/em&gt;” Haroun mimics her angry finger jabbing and smiles warmly. “She had a very strong personality. Normally, a woman would never do this. The shame!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haroun’s boyhood instilled in him, he says, a respect for women. But in his career as Chad’s only prominent film-maker – and one of Africa’s best known cinematic exports – he has told stories about men and boys. His gorgeous film &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/nov/22/artsfeatures5"&gt;Abouna&lt;/a&gt; is about two young brothers searching for their father. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/15/a-screaming-man-haroun-djaoro"&gt;A Screaming Man&lt;/a&gt; told the tale of a hotel pool attendant who packs his son off to war; after it won the jury prize at Cannes in 2010, the government in Chad rebuilt the country’s only cinema (it has been closed since the beginning of the pandemic).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/04/mahamat-saleh-haroun-abortion-drama-chad-achouackh-abakar-souleymane-lingui"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>James McAvoy: ‘Play Hamlet? Nah – he’s always seemed a bit of a moaner to me’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/03/james-mcavoy-hamlet-moaner-cyrano-rapping-homoerotic-partygate-lear</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;He came blazing out of Glasgow like a rocket, scoring hits and acclaim. As he returns to the stage in a hard-rapping, homoerotic Cyrano de Bergerac, the star talks about partygate, snout size – and tackling Lear when he hits 100&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James McAvoy is talking about Cyrano de Bergerac, the long-nosed, lovestruck poet &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/dec/09/cyrano-de-bergerac-review-james-mcavoy-playhouse-london-martin-crimp-rostand-nose-wooing"&gt;he first played on stage in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and is now about to reprise. But every now and again he interrupts himself with off-piste observations that have nothing to do with 17th-century libertines and doomed love triangles. It slowly becomes clear that he is inside his car, which is parked at the stage door of the Harold Pinter theatre in London, ready to jump into rehearsals after our chat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s this guy doing?” he says, in his meta commentary of people-watching.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Oh my God. There’s a labourer walking down the road and he doesn’t have any trousers on. He’s just in long johns and he has got the biggest penis I think I’ve ever seen.” Wait, how can he tell? “Because he’s wearing long johns! And he’s packing a nine-inch –”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/03/james-mcavoy-hamlet-moaner-cyrano-rapping-homoerotic-partygate-lear"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘I know what anxiety is. And guilt’: Florian Zeller on his nightmarish new play</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/31/florian-zeller-father-oscar-forest-nightmarish-new-play</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The French prodigy, who won an Oscar for The Father, talks about The Forest, his labyrinthine new drama following a man whose life unravels after an affair&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florian Zeller has made a speciality of disorienting his audiences. Last year, the skilfully blurred timeline of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jun/10/the-father-review-anthony-hopkins-olivia-colman-florian-zeller"&gt;The Father&lt;/a&gt;, based on his own Alzheimer’s-inspired play, landed him an Oscar for best adapted screenplay, along with a best actor award for Anthony Hopkins. Yet the French playwright and director’s new work, The Forest, about to have its world premiere at Hampstead theatre in London, may be his most disconcerting yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I tried to create a maze,” Zeller says over Zoom from his home in Paris. On stage, scenes repeat themselves with micro-variations: different actors may or may not be playing the same person. “The goal wasn’t to lose people in this forest. It was to put them in a confusing situation and let them piece it together.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/31/florian-zeller-father-oscar-forest-nightmarish-new-play"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Souvenir: Part II – Joanna Hogg’s creative coming-of-age tale is a triumph</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/06/the-souvenir-part-ii-joanna-hogg-soul-searching-sequel-is-a-triumph-honor-swinton-byrne-tilda-swinton</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Part two of Hogg’s semi-autobiographical drama, in which a young film-maker finds her creative path after a doomed love affair, is the director’s most accessible work to date&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is “The Souvenir”? In Joanna Hogg’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/01/the-souvenir-review-joanna-hogg-tom-burke-honor-swinton-byrne-tilda-swinton"&gt;autobiographically inspired 2019 drama&lt;/a&gt;, that title appeared to refer specifically to an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/sep/15/lovestruck-woman-in-painting-inspired-film-cinema-hit"&gt;18th-century Fragonard painting&lt;/a&gt; depicting a young woman (the heroine of Rousseau’s epistolary novel &lt;em&gt;Julie&lt;/em&gt;, apparently) carving the name of her lover into a tree trunk. In that film, set in the 1980s, Julie Harte (played by Hogg’s goddaughter Honor Swinton Byrne) is introduced to the painting by an enigmatic man with whom she is falling in love. Like Hogg, Julie is perplexed by what the painting means and by her own increasingly tumultuous feelings for her mysterious companion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this flipside second instalment of Hogg’s most personal and surprisingly most accessible work, the word “souvenir” takes on a rather more metatextual meaning. This time the film itself becomes a kind of cinematic keepsake, a memory of a memory (or a dream of a dream?) set in the aftermath of Julie’s relationship with the heroin-addicted Anthony. An overwhelming presence in the first episode, as portrayed by Tom Burke, Anthony is now an even more confounding &lt;em&gt;absence&lt;/em&gt;, leaving Julie struggling to make sense of their former life together, with all its mysteries and misdirections. Who &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; her lover? Did she ever really know him? Did he actually work for the Foreign Office? Where did he go as the end approached? Who did he talk to? What was he thinking?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/06/the-souvenir-part-ii-joanna-hogg-soul-searching-sequel-is-a-triumph-honor-swinton-byrne-tilda-swinton"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Streaming: Mass and other great single location films</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/22/streaming-mass-and-other-great-single-location-films</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mass, about the meeting of two sets of parents after a school shooting, joins classics including Rope and My Dinner With Andre that thrive within the confines of a single set&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Stagey” is a term generally used as a slight against a film, evoking that stiff, musty sense of confinement so particular to a bad play. But it doesn’t have to be. Some films use the restrictions of theatre – a small cast, a single location – to match on camera the intensity and intimacy of live performance, fused with the very screen-specific benefits of the closeup. American actor turned director Fran Kranz’s impressive debut feature, &lt;strong&gt;Mass&lt;/strong&gt; (now streaming on Sky Cinema), is one such film. Set entirely within a suburban Episcopal church, and mostly within the four walls of a bland function room, it is stagey in the tensest, tautest sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The setup is simple and wrenching: the church hall has been chosen as a neutral space for peace talks of a kind, between two sets of parents who are at once strangers to each other and inextricably connected by the tragedy of a school shooting – that most increasingly, queasily familiar of American atrocities. Depending on your point of view, there’s either much to be said here or nothing at all: eventually, they opt for the former, talking through waves and counter-waves of grief, guilt and white-hot anger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/22/streaming-mass-and-other-great-single-location-films"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Book of Boba Fett: has it ruined the character’s Star Wars legacy?</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/04/the-book-of-boba-fett-wrecked-star-wars-coolest-character-mandalorian</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There has been much to enjoy in the Mandalorian spinoff, very little of it anything to do with the title character. He should have kept the helmet on and remained a mystery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many wonderful things about &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/19/boba-fett-is-dead-how-disney-ruined-star-wars-coolest-character"&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/a&gt;, Disney+’s new TV show about the bounty hunter who was first introduced in George Lucas’s original Star Wars trilogy. Unfortunately, the title character is not one of them. Which makes it a strange viewing experience, and one that should make fans question their abiding fascination for the jetpack-sporting killer-for-hire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve had the return of Timothy Olyphant’s Cobb Vanth, a space cowboy to rival even Pedro Pascal’s Din Djarin for sharp-shooting insouciance. There’s that dark, black-eyed Wookiee, who has to be the most terrifying thing seen in Star Wars since it was revealed Jar Bar Binks had been elected to the Galactic Senate. In the most recent episode we got nearly 20 minutes of Luke Skywalker teaching Baby Yoda Jedi skills, while chatting casually to the incredible Rosario Dawson’s Ahsoka Tano. Geek heads duly spun right off shoulders. Was that the new Jedi temple all those multi-limbed robots were building? Do the Sand People really have personalities? What on Tatooine does the Hutts’ home planet look like? OMG is that Cad Bane from the Clone Wars show, realised in live action? The good stuff has been pretty much never-ending.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/04/the-book-of-boba-fett-wrecked-star-wars-coolest-character-mandalorian"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Why the heavily criticised digital revolution has been good for cinema</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/sep/20/why-the-heavily-criticised-digital-revolution-has-been-good-for-cinema</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Director Patty Jenkins recently condemned films produced by streamers as “fake movies”, but the evolution has opened doors for diversity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1993, digital technology was revolutionising cinema; now it threatens to destroy it. The omens were there 28 years ago: the highest-grossing movie that year was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/02/my-favourite-film-aged-12-jurassic-park"&gt;Jurassic Park&lt;/a&gt;, whose dinosaurs ironically represented an evolutionary leap. Audiences were wowed by those hyper-realistic digital effects – all six minutes of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no big franchise or effects movies among that year’s UK Top 10: it was stuff such as Aladdin, The Bodyguard and Coppola’s Dracula, (mostly released in 1992 in the US). These days it’s rare to find a non-franchise movie in the top spots, and just as rare to find six CGI-free minutes in any of them. Digital has revolutionised form and content. Exacerbated by the pandemic, streaming services are on the up, blockbusters are released online at the same time as in cinemas and movie theatres are struggling to stay open.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/sep/20/why-the-heavily-criticised-digital-revolution-has-been-good-for-cinema"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The 50 best films of 2021 in the UK, No 8: Azor</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/08/the-50-best-films-of-2021-in-the-uk-no-8-azor</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An eerie, unsettling conspiracy drama about the ultra-wealthy from director Andreas Fontana, in which a Swiss banker navigates Argentina’s dirty war&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/30/the-50-best-films-of-2021-in-the-uk"&gt;50 best films of 2021 in the UK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/series/best-culture-2021"&gt;More on the best culture of 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pure evil is all around in this unnervingly subtle, sophisticated movie; it is a conspiracy drama-thriller, shot with a kind of desiccated blankness, about the occult world of super-wealth and things not to be talked about. The title is a Swiss banker’s codeword in conversation for “be silent”. It is set in 1980 in Argentina, at the time of the junta’s dirty war against leftists and dissidents. Azor gives a queasy new perspective on the horror of those times, and there is even a nauseous echo of the Swiss banks’ attitude to their German neighbours in the second world war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yvan (Fabrizio Rongione) is a private banker from Geneva – elegant, discreet, an excellent speaker of Spanish, English and French – who is making what appears to be an emergency diplomatic visit to soothe his well-heeled and secretive clients in Argentina, in the company of his elegant, supportive wife Inès (Stéphanie Cléau). Yvan’s rich clientele are deeply troubled by the new political regime; they fear that they could find their assets being sequestrated by the government. And what is even worse is that these people were used to dealing with Yvan’s colleague Réné, a genial and exuberant figure who has also now vanished.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/08/the-50-best-films-of-2021-in-the-uk-no-8-azor"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The 50 best films of 2021 in the UK, No 9: The Lost Daughter</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/07/the-50-best-films-of-2021-in-the-uk-no-9-the-lost-daughter</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Olivia Colman is mesmerising in Maggie Gyllenhaal’s delicious adaptation of the Elena Ferrante novel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/30/the-50-best-films-of-2021-in-the-uk"&gt;50 best films of 2021 in the UK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/best-culture-2021"&gt;More on the best culture of 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olivia Colman gives a powerhouse turn in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/sep/03/the-lost-daughter-review-olivia-colman-maggie-gyllenhaal-elena-ferrante"&gt;The Lost Daughter&lt;/a&gt;, prickly and combustible as Leda Caruso, a middle-aged languages professor on a working holiday in Greece. In flight from her past, possibly from herself, she stares at the sea as though it’s done her a great wrong and eats alone at the bar, repelling anyone who draws close. She haunts the resort like a ghost while other ghosts are haunting her. In an excellent directing debut, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/maggie-gyllenhaal"&gt;Maggie Gyllenhaal&lt;/a&gt; turns &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/29/elena-ferrante-we-dont-have-to-fear-change-what-is-other-shouldnt-frighten-us"&gt;Elena Ferrante&lt;/a&gt;’s 2008 source novel into humid, sensual cinema. This is Colman’s stage and her tragedy; you can’t take your eyes off her for a second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leda can’t seem to relax into her tranquil island break: she’s disturbed by the unruly, faintly criminal family from Queens that rents the enormous pink villa just up the coastline. Nina (Dakota Johnson), the brood’s volatile young mother, mislays her infant daughter on the beach. The daughter, in turn, has mislaid her favourite doll. Leda immediately collects them both: she returns the child right away but, prompted by some repressed maternal memory, keeps the doll for herself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/07/the-50-best-films-of-2021-in-the-uk-no-9-the-lost-daughter"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The 50 best films of 2021 in the UK, No 10: The Tragedy of Macbeth</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/06/the-50-best-films-of-2021-in-the-uk-no-10-the-tragedy-of-macbeth</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Joel Coen’s icy, black-and-white world of violence and pain is a triumph, with Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand at their peak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/30/the-50-best-films-of-2021-in-the-uk"&gt;50 best films of 2021 in the UK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/nov/30/the-50-best-films-of-2021-in-the-us"&gt;50 best films of 2021 in the US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/series/best-culture-2021"&gt;More on the best culture of 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joel Coen’s solo take on Shakespeare is a stark monochrome nightmare, refrigerated to an icy coldness. The text has been whittled; the drama is framed in theatrical, stylised ways: an agoraphobic ordeal in which bodies and faces loom up with tin-tack sharpness out of the creamy white fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frances McDormand is Lady Macbeth, a role she was born to play, bringing a hard-won domestic authority and her own sort of military determination to the plan to kill King Duncan. Macbeth is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/denzelwashington"&gt;Denzel Washington&lt;/a&gt;, who portrays the Thane as already exhausted by his great triumph in the king’s cause at the very beginning, a moment at which he might be expected to look forward to retirement. Washington’s signature rolling swagger looks careworn, but his Macbeth submits to both the duplicitous supernatural promises and his wife’s demands, like a soldier taking his orders. And then, angry and paranoid, he escalates his fanatical rule with a series of pre-emptive murders, while McDormand’s Lady Macbeth retreats into horror and despair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/06/the-50-best-films-of-2021-in-the-uk-no-10-the-tragedy-of-macbeth"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What would happen if digital avatars were truer reflections of the self, asks writer-director Mamoru Hosoda, in this all-out beautiful film&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pink-haired pop star soars on to the screen riding a giant blue whale. The crowd cheers as her dress explodes, raining multicoloured petals. In this gorgeous, big-hearted anime from Mamoru Hosoda (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/02/mirai-review-mamoru-hosoda"&gt;Mirai&lt;/a&gt;, Summer Wars&lt;/em&gt;), Belle is the virtual avatar of Suzu (Kaho Nakamura), a grieving teenager and “mousy country bumpkin”, according to her best friend. We soon learn that her mother, who taught her to play the piano, died when she was a child. Suzu hasn’t been able to sing since. U is a virtual reality she accesses via an app on her phone. It’s here, inside this twinkling digital metropolis, that Suzu becomes Belle and rediscovers her voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When one of Belle’s concerts is interrupted by a mysterious horned Dragon (Takeru Satoh), U’s self-appointed police step in, threatening to catch him and expose his true identity. Understanding the protection afforded by adopting an avatar, Belle goes out of her way to protect him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/06/belle-review-gorgeous-big-hearted-anime-mamoru-hosoda"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
