      <title>Thomasina Miers’ recipe for harissa roast sprouts with lemon-tahini yoghurt | The new flexitarian</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/07/thomasina-miers-recipe-harissa-roast-sprouts-lemon-tahini-yoghurt</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A triplet of contrasting flavours: nutty roast sprouts, fiery harissa and cooling yoghurt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sprouts are &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sweeter nowadays;&lt;/strong&gt; technology has been used to wean out some of the bitter notes. Even so, there are ways you can cook sprouts to bring out their milder notes: one is to pan-fry them, another is roasting. The latter makes them taste almost nutty when they come out of the oven, making them delicious with this fiery harissa and soothing yoghurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK readers: &lt;a href="https://www.ocado.com/search?entry=10000097360&amp;amp;utm_source=guardian-feast&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=guardian-feast-recipe"&gt;click to buy these ingredients&lt;/a&gt; from Ocado&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/07/thomasina-miers-recipe-harissa-roast-sprouts-lemon-tahini-yoghurt"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Rachel Roddy’s recipe for chocolate, almond and cherry cake | A kitchen in Rome</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/07/rachel-roddys-recipe-chocolate-almond-cherry-cake</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Luxurious yet simple, this combination of flavours is inspired by the enterprising, artistic spirit of the Fabbri family&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gennaro Fabbri had a plan. He would stop selling chairs and find a small shop with a &lt;em&gt;vinaia&lt;/em&gt; (wine cellar) that could be converted into a distillery for the production of &lt;em&gt;liquori&lt;/em&gt; and syrups. He found what he was looking for in the main piazza of a small town called Portomaggiore in the province of Ferrara, in Emilia-Romagna. Helped by a loan from his brother, Antonio, Gennaro made the necessary alterations to the old grocery shop and gave it a new name, Premiata Distilleria G Fabbri&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The year was 1905.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the first products was a liqueur called 1° Maggio, named for 1 May, Labour Day. The yellow liquer came in a flask-like bottle labelled with an picture of two workers shaking hands, beside them a sickle and a hammer, and behind them the rising sun. 1° Maggio was a well-priced, everyman’s drink celebrating the dawn of a new century. It was followed by an amaro called Carducci&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and, soon after that, Virov&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; a yolk-yellow zabaione-like drink made from egg and marsala. Success was swift and, by the early 1920s, Gennaro had taken on a small factory in Bologna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK readers: &lt;a href="https://www.ocado.com/search?entry=10000097363&amp;amp;utm_source=guardian-feast&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=guardian-feast-recipe"&gt;click to buy these ingredients&lt;/a&gt; from Ocado&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/07/rachel-roddys-recipe-chocolate-almond-cherry-cake"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Sonal Ved’s Indian ‘pasta’ recipes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pasta is a common ingredient in Indian regional cuisine: try this hearty Kashmiri stew with flattened dough balls, or a spicy mutton and macaroni casserole that’s often enjoyed at Eid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years ago, before I began research for my book &lt;a href="https://www.blackdogandleventhal.com/?s=Tiffin"&gt;Tiffin: 500 Authentic Recipes Celebrating India’s Regional Cuisine&lt;/a&gt;, I had no idea that there was something like an Indian “pasta”. The dictionary describes pasta as “food made from flour, water and sometimes eggs, formed into different shapes”, and by that definition, I was effortlessly able to put many traditional recipes into this description. While in some cases the dough has hints of spices such as turmeric and is rolled at home from scratch, store-bought pasta is often tipped straight into gravies and curries. Each Indian region has its own version of “pasta”, ranging from &lt;em&gt;kev&lt;/em&gt; in Ladakh to &lt;em&gt;saravle&lt;/em&gt; on the Konkan coast and &lt;em&gt;dal dhokli&lt;/em&gt; in the west of India. Here, I’ve picked two recipes that showcase pasta-based Indian regional cooking at its best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK readers: &lt;a href="https://www.ocado.com/search?entry=10000097362&amp;amp;utm_source=guardian-feast&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=guardian-feast-recipe"&gt;click to buy these ingredients&lt;/a&gt; from Ocado&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK readers: &lt;a href="https://www.ocado.com/search?entry=10000097361&amp;amp;utm_source=guardian-feast&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=guardian-feast-recipe"&gt;click to buy these ingredients&lt;/a&gt; from Ocado&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/05/dabba-gosht-potato-pea-pasta-stew-skyu-lamb-pasta-potato-hotpot-sonal-ved-indian-pasta-recipes"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Ixta Belfrage’s vegan recipe for creamy saffron orzo with roast butternut and scotch bonnet | The new vegan</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/05/vegan-recipe-creamy-saffron-orzo-roast-butternut-scotch-bonnet-ixta-belfrage</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A risotto-style pasta in a creamy, saffron-infused sauce and topped with spicy roast squash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was asked to look after this column while &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/meera-sodha"&gt;Meera Sodha&lt;/a&gt; takes a well-deserved break, I was both nervous (those are some big metaphorical shoes to fill) and excited, but I won’t pretend I wasn’t also slightly apprehensive of the fact that this is a vegan column. Not because I don’t love vegetables (I do!), but because I didn’t want to come across as disingenuous (let it be known that I’m very much an omnivore) and also because the idea of being limited by the ingredients I could use worried me. I’m happy to report, however, that this has been a welcome challenge and that, in the right circumstances, limitations can push the boundaries of creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK readers: &lt;a href="https://www.ocado.com/search?entry=10000097371&amp;amp;utm_source=guardian-feast&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=guardian-feast-recipe"&gt;click to buy these ingredients&lt;/a&gt; from Ocado&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/05/vegan-recipe-creamy-saffron-orzo-roast-butternut-scotch-bonnet-ixta-belfrage"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Nigel Slater’s recipes for roast artichoke broth, and for potatoes with rosemary</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/06/nigel-slaters-recipes-for-roast-artichoke-broth-and-for-potatoes-with-rosemary</link>
      <description>Warm your soul with a nourishing bowl of broth&lt;p&gt;There is something grounding about a bowl of broth. A glistening stock to bring us back to earth. It is where so many recipes start, but I like it as it stands, to eat as a sustaining soup, the brown liquor ladled into deep bowls; the steam aromatic and bosky from dried mushrooms and woody herbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No bones are needed. The backbone comes from dried shiitake or cepes, onions browned in the oven and tough stalks of thyme. The broth is the soul and benefits from the usual onion, carrot and celery, bay leaves and a splash from the bottom of a bottle – sherry, marsala or sake. You could add juniper berries if you wish or coriander seeds. It is ready in half an hour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/06/nigel-slaters-recipes-for-roast-artichoke-broth-and-for-potatoes-with-rosemary"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Food House, London: ‘Full on, in a very good way’ – restaurant review</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/06/food-house-london-restaurant-review-jay-rayner</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The address has long been a family favourite, but the new owners provide a great reason to revisit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food House, 46 Gerrard Street, London W1D 5QH (020 7287 2818). Starters £5.80-£9.80; large dishes £9.80-£24.80; hot pot £18-£38.80; whole fish £36. Wines from £19.80&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All parents will retain a deep affection for any restaurant where their once small children were happy, and the family therefore harmonious and nobody died and can we all go home now please? It’s why Pizza Express retains the love of a slab of the British middle classes, despite endless whining over the current quality of the pizzas, and the silliness of the one with the hole in the middle, and the blood-sucking endeavours of venture capital firms. They have managed to retain a culture that is welcoming to small kids, without infantilising their weary parents. It’s a neat trick. And if you still want to rant about why Pizza Express is terrible, please take it up over on Reddit. Someone there will be gagging for your hot take.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/06/food-house-london-restaurant-review-jay-rayner"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/04/cocktail-of-the-week-the-cobblers-apprentice-sherry-coffee-liqueur-citrus-recipe</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coffee flavours meet citrus and sherry in this low-alcohol pick-me-up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This take on the classic sherry cobbler is a refreshing, low-ABV cocktail with hints of coffee, making it ideal for brunch or for the start of a night out. It’s a firm favourite at the Apothecary bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK readers: &lt;a href="https://www.ocado.com/search?entry=10000097367&amp;amp;utm_source=guardian-feast&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=guardian-feast-recipe"&gt;click to buy these ingredients&lt;/a&gt; from Ocado&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/04/cocktail-of-the-week-the-cobblers-apprentice-sherry-coffee-liqueur-citrus-recipe"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Benjamina Ebuehi’s recipe for a salty honey-glazed tahini loaf | The sweet spot</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/04/salty-honey-glazed-tahini-loaf-recipe-benjamina-ebuehi</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tahini lends a savoury versatility to this not-too-sweet cake, with nutty undertones and rounded off with an irresistible glaze&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tahini is one of my most-used ingredients, especially in cakes. When paired with something sweet like honey, it really shines. I can’t get enough of that classic sweet and salty flavour combination, and this cake is all about that. The tahini brings a deeply savoury vibe, which makes it great for those who aren’t into overly sweet desserts. The sticky, buttery glaze on the sesame-studded crust is my favourite bit – I always save it until last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK readers: &lt;a href="https://www.ocado.com/search?entry=10000097359&amp;amp;utm_source=guardian-feast&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=guardian-feast-recipe"&gt;click to buy these ingredients&lt;/a&gt; from Ocado&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/04/salty-honey-glazed-tahini-loaf-recipe-benjamina-ebuehi"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>How to make the perfect pork (or chicken, duck or tofu) larb – recipe | Felicity Cloake's How to make the perfect…</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/02/how-to-make-the-perfect-pork-or-chicken-duck-or-tofu-larb-recipe</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Larb, larp, laap, lap … however you spell it, this salty-sour staple of south-east Asia has myriad versions, which won’t stop our resident perfectionist from seeking out the best&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://shesimmers.com/2009/06/how-to-make-larb-gai-lahb-gai-laab-gai-larp-gai-laap-gai-lahb-gai-%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%9A%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%81%E0%B9%88.html"&gt;Larb, also transcribed as larp, lap, laap, laarp and laab&lt;/a&gt;, is a dish that doesn’t fit easily into western boxes. A highly seasoned mixture of chopped meat, fish, tofu or mushrooms – Thai food writer&lt;a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/simple-thai-food-classic-recipes-from-the-thai-home-kitchen-by-leela-punyaratabandhu-cookbook-review-206240"&gt; Leela Punyaratabandhu&lt;/a&gt; clarifies that laab “is a verb denoting the mincing of meat” – that, as fellow Thai food writer&lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/i-relocated-to-thailand-in-the-middle-of-the-pandemic-then-delta-hit-25pbw78f3"&gt; Kay Plunkett-Hogge&lt;/a&gt; observes, can “also be referred to as a salad by virtue of its being served frequently in lettuce leaves”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not even strictly Thai, though the travel hub of south-east Asia is where most Brits are likely to have come across it; a speciality of the north, it’s said to have originated with the Tai people, and variations on the dish are also found in Laos, Myanmar and south-western China. The one you’re most likely to be familiar with, though, is &lt;em&gt;laarp isaan&lt;/em&gt;, from the north-eastern Thai region of the same name: as Punyaratabandhu explains, “the way lap is made varies from province to province, and it is hard to nail down a normative version – if there is one. But this version is the most common in Bangkok and at Thai restaurants outside Thailand. It also happens to be one of the simplest.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/02/how-to-make-the-perfect-pork-or-chicken-duck-or-tofu-larb-recipe"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>How to make good meals without loads of washing-up | Kitchen aide</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/01/how-to-make-good-meals-without-loads-of-washing-up-kitchen-aide</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Traybakes, one-pot pastas, soups and stews are your best pals if you want to avoid a load of dirty dishes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Got a culinary dilemma? Email &lt;a href="mailto:feast@theguardian.com"&gt;feast@theguardian.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m fed up with domestic drudgery. Which meals generate the least washing-up?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hannah, London&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re speaking Roberta Hall-McCarron’s language, Hannah: “There’s so much prep and washing up at work, I try to keep things really simple at home,” says the chef/owner of &lt;a href="https://www.thelittlechartroom.com/"&gt;The Little Chartroom&lt;/a&gt; in Edinburgh. A broth, she adds, is a good place to start: “That could be chicken or veggie stock, or go down a more Asian route with coconut milk and Thai curry paste.” Hall-McCarron then chucks in whatever vegetables takes her fancy, adding them to the pot according to how long they take to cook, maybe some meat or fish, too, and noodles or rice. “Not only are you getting all the flavour from the broth going into everything you put in the pot, you’ve also got only one pot to wash up afterwards.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/01/how-to-make-good-meals-without-loads-of-washing-up-kitchen-aide"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/01/nigel-slater-midweek-recipe-baked-sweet-potatoes-tomato-sauce</link>
      <description>A nourishing, hearty, sweet-sour vegan treat&lt;p&gt;Preheat the oven to 220C/gas mark 7. Peel 850g of &lt;strong&gt;sweet potatoes&lt;/strong&gt;, cut them into large pieces, then pile them into a steamer basket or colander resting over a pan of boiling water. Cover tightly with a lid and let them steam for about 15 minutes, maybe less, until they are tender enough to crush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put 500g of &lt;strong&gt;tomatoes&lt;/strong&gt; in a baking dish and trickle them with 4 tbsp of &lt;strong&gt;olive oil&lt;/strong&gt;. Peel and finely slice 2 medium-sized cloves of &lt;strong&gt;garlic&lt;/strong&gt; and add them to the tomatoes. Chop 6 &lt;strong&gt;spring onions&lt;/strong&gt; and add them, stirring them into the oil. Stir in 2 tsp of &lt;strong&gt;mustard seeds&lt;/strong&gt; and 1 level tsp of &lt;strong&gt;turmeric&lt;/strong&gt;. Season with &lt;strong&gt;sea salt&lt;/strong&gt;. Toss the tomatoes, aromatics and oil together.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/01/nigel-slater-midweek-recipe-baked-sweet-potatoes-tomato-sauce"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Thomasina Miers’ recipe for steamed fish with Sichuan sauce and greens | The new flexitarian</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/31/steamed-fish-sichuan-sauce-greens-thomasina-miers-recipe</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A salty-sweet riot of succulent fish and greens with a heady sauce full of nutty sesame, chilli heat and fragrant anise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vibrant dish is blissfully easy. Nutty, hot, fragrant, mouth-numbing and addictively salty-sweet, the sauce dresses the clean taste of the white fish and greens beautifully. You’ll want lots of rice alongside to soak up all those flavours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK readers: &lt;a href="https://www.ocado.com/search?entry=10000097324&amp;amp;utm_source=guardian-feast&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=guardian-feast-recipe"&gt;click to buy these ingredients&lt;/a&gt; from Ocado&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/31/steamed-fish-sichuan-sauce-greens-thomasina-miers-recipe"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Rachel Roddy’s recipe for cauliflower and potato bake | A kitchen in Rome</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/31/rachel-roddys-recipe-cauliflower-and-potato-bake-sformato</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An easy-going, reliable Roman recipe that’s a cross between cauliflower cheese and potato gratin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1961, there were 10 porters working at Testaccio market. Known as &lt;em&gt;facchini,&lt;/em&gt; these men and boys were the moving muscles of the market, transporting both the stall structures, which were still unfixed, and fruit and vegetables from warehouses near Monte Testaccio to the market square. Once the market and stalls were set up, it was the work of &lt;em&gt;i facchini &lt;/em&gt;to ferry produce from the market to the dozens of &lt;em&gt;trattorie, osterie&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; pizzerie &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; tavole calde&lt;/em&gt; in Testaccio and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1961, Silvio started working alongside his brother. He was 11. Their parents were longstanding vendors; at first, they had a fruit and vegetable stall, then, after the war, a grocery stall. The boys were born into the market universe; everyone knew them and they knew everyone, every bolt and corner, every trattoria kitchen door. It would be a few years before Silvio was considered a&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;facchino, although from the first day he worked as hard as anyone else, proud of his memory, strength and ability to manoeuvre a trolley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK readers: &lt;a href="https://www.ocado.com/search?entry=10000097326&amp;amp;utm_source=guardian-feast&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=guardian-feast-recipe"&gt;click to buy these ingredients&lt;/a&gt; from Ocado&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/31/rachel-roddys-recipe-cauliflower-and-potato-bake-sformato"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Nigel Slater’s recipes for slow-cooked aubergine, and for orange and almond cakes</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/30/nigel-slater-recipes-aubergine-with-yoghurt-and-cucumber-orange-almond-bundt-cake</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Find your comfort zone with silky aubergines followed by a moist orange bundt cake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My greengrocer sells aubergines of various sizes in precarious piles, each one as glossy as wet paint. Removing the one you want is like playing vegetable Jenga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like my aubergines baked until on the verge of being overcooked. So silky, so plump, so melting, they’re almost more olive oil than aubergine. And let’s face it, without olive oil there is very little point to this vegetable (fruit to the pedantic). Baked or grilled, I cook them with their skins on – and eat them too. I only occasionally take the peeler to them, but they look elegant without their skins, scattered with lemon zest and parsley or in a pool of their own bronze baking juices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/30/nigel-slater-recipes-aubergine-with-yoghurt-and-cucumber-orange-almond-bundt-cake"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Barbecue pork and noodle broth: Amy Poon’s char siu and zha jiang noodle recipes</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/29/char-siu-pork-zha-jiang-noodles-recipes-amy-poon</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional Cantonese barbecue pork in a fragrant marinade, and a special family recipe for noodles in pork and chicken broth and topped with a salty-sweet sauce&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are two dishes to celebrate Chinese New Year on February 1: the first is a modern, simple twist on an old classic, and the other one of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Poon"&gt;my father’s&lt;/a&gt; most popular creations. He conceived the noodle dish when he opened the first Poon’s &amp;amp; Co restaurant in London’s Chinatown in 1973, and even though that closed back in 2004, people still ask him about it. The char siu, meanwhile, is something we came up with when we did Poon’s pop-up a few years ago and needed an alternative to a traditional Chinese barbecue roasting oven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK readers: &lt;a href="https://www.ocado.com/search?entry=10000097332&amp;amp;utm_source=guardian-feast&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=guardian-feast-recipe"&gt;click to buy these ingredients&lt;/a&gt; from Ocado&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/29/char-siu-pork-zha-jiang-noodles-recipes-amy-poon"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Renaissant, Bagnor, Berkshire: ‘A paean to butter and time spent huddled over pans’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/04/grace-dent-renaissant-bagnor-berkshire-restaurant-review</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;‘The place dances a fine line between the almost-too-rich and the almost-too-much’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My abiding memory of chef Dom Robinson’s &lt;a href="https://www.restaurantrenaissant.com/"&gt;Renaissant&lt;/a&gt;, a fine-dining restaurant in Bagnor, Berkshire, is of witnessing the greatest standoff over a tasting menu I’ve ever seen. A couple had foolishly arrived for their Saturday-night booking, imagining there to be an à la carte menu, rather than just a bespoke seven-course experience that lasts about three hours. “But we went out for lunch,” they pleaded. “We’re too full to eat the full seven courses. Can’t we have just, say, three?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, this was impossible. Unthinkable, even. It was the full shebang, or nothing. A painfully polite, low-volume “discussion” then ensued, during which the server made no attempt to consult the chef. Or even offer a goodwill gesture to cancel, say, the “baguette française, Normandy butter” course, or the Victoria pineapple plate that comes around the midway point. It was almost as if the staff already knew that not one amuse-bouche could be missed. “Well, we’ll go then,” the customers eventually said, calling Renaissant’s bluff. A long silence hung in the air, followed by the sound of footsteps crunching across the car park gravel as the pair huffed back to their car. It was only 7pm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/04/grace-dent-renaissant-bagnor-berkshire-restaurant-review"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Kibou, London SW11: ‘Very much a place of contradictions’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/28/kibou-london-sw11-restaurant-review-grace-dent</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;‘I excused myself to go to the ladies’ room to have a long think about my life choices’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restaurant columns don’t generally begin in the ladies’ loo for several reasons, but in real life they often do – or at least they do for me. Some time after the first plates of starters at a new opening, such as at &lt;a href="https://kibou.co.uk/london/"&gt;Kibou in Battersea&lt;/a&gt; last week, I often find myself staring into a bathroom mirror – a freshly installed bathroom mirror, mind – and the words are already bubbling, because when you know, you already know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kibou’s new south London branch is the third in a chain of beautifully staged, Japanese-inspired restaurants with a loyal following in &lt;a href="https://kibou.co.uk/cheltenham/"&gt;Cheltenham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://kibou.co.uk/kibou-clifton/"&gt;Bristol&lt;/a&gt;. The Battersea branch has two enormous, fluttery lashed, mascara-laden eyes painted on to its Hague Blue frontage. Those eyes are made prettier still by faux Japanese rose blossom. Kibou is certainly, from the outside and at night, the loveliest, quirkiest-looking new opening London has seen in a while. Inside, vast murals of Tokyo metropolitan life brighten the walls. The best seats in the house are the booths at the back, bedecked with even more faux blossom. Romantic as heck. But it’s less so if you’re seated near the front door on one of the tiny, draughty, exposed tables.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/28/kibou-london-sw11-restaurant-review-grace-dent"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Juke &amp; Loe, Sheffield: ‘Bold cooking designed to satisfy’ – restaurant review</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/30/juke-and-low-sheffield-bold-cooking-designed-to-satisfy-restaurant-review</link>
      <description>A louche lunch at Sheffield’s Juke &amp;amp; Loe proves there’s no better place to be on a Friday afternoon&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Juke and Loe, 617 Ecclesall Rd, Sheffield S11 8PT (0114 268 0271, &lt;a href="https://jukeandloe.com/"&gt;jukeandloe.com&lt;/a&gt;). Lunch – two courses £25, three courses £30. Dinner – starters £14-£16, mains £24-£30, desserts £10. Wines from £24&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is time to address the most pressing question of the age: when going out to eat during the week, which is better, lunch or dinner? The arguments for dinner are cheerfully robust. The working day is at an end, so we are not dodging important jobs like pretending to study a vital spreadsheet while actually watching hilarious reels on Instagram of dogs being shocked by their own farts. Mostly we are not dodging our own puritan guilt. We are free to show the wine list some truly grown-up, adult love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/30/juke-and-low-sheffield-bold-cooking-designed-to-satisfy-restaurant-review"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Victoria, Oxshott, Surrey: ‘A proper trousers sort of place’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurants</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/21/the-victoria-oxshott-surrey-restaurant-review-grace-dent</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;‘There’s a fish and chips main course option at £19, feasibly to stop the locals from rioting, but then prices hurtle upwards rather dramatically’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All pub grub is not built the same. Some is sublime, worth booking ahead for and travelling miles to get to; some is the reheated or deep-fried contents of various freezer bags and flung at plates. My job – and it is a real job – is to decipher what goes in which category. Take &lt;a href="https://thevictoriaoxshott.com/"&gt;the Victoria at Oxshott&lt;/a&gt; in Surrey, for example: newly refurbished and reopened, and with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/the-fat-duck"&gt;Fat Duck&lt;/a&gt; alumni at the helm, which feels instinctively like the sort of place you should force your partner to change into trousers for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charles and I frequently lock horns whenever we set off somewhere like this, which claims to be a pub but in fact serves “pan-fried” stone bass with keta caviar and smoked confit duck with pistachio. “But it’s a pub,” he’ll say, casting a hand over his designer track pants. “No,” I’ll reply. “They do wagyu bavette and rib-eye with bordelaise sauce. It’s trousers, proper trousers.” And off he’ll trudge back to the wardrobe in the manner of a man forced to complete the London marathon in a 140lb vintage deep-sea diving suit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That isn’t to say the Victoria specifies any sort of official dress code; rather that some places just exude a certain level of genteel correctness. The dining room is rather dreamily staged, like an olde English inn with the light blueprint of a pricy West End brasserie, all cosily furnished, with burgundy panelling, low beams and an open fire. Chef director Matt Larcombe was once head chef at &lt;a href="https://www.thecrownatbray.com/"&gt;The Crown at Bray&lt;/a&gt;, and met manager Simon King when both worked for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/heston-blumenthal"&gt;Heston Blumenthal&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a bar area for locals and an extensive regular wine list that starts with house white, a grenache blanc, at £25, as well as a “rare wine menu” from which, if you’re really making a night of it, you can blow £9,750 on a bottle of 1997 Screaming Eagle cabernet sauvignon from the Napa Valley. See? I told you it’s a proper trousers type of place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/21/the-victoria-oxshott-surrey-restaurant-review-grace-dent"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Old-world wines v new: what’s the difference? | Fiona Beckett on drinks</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/04/old-world-wines-v-new-whats-the-difference-fiona-beckett</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;More eclectic tastes and globalism have blurred the distinctions between old- and new-world wines, so much so that many new-world styles could these days pass for old, and vice versa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EmilySaladino/status/1478486138679697414?s=20"&gt;Someone on Twitter recently asked&lt;/a&gt; if it was it appropriate to use the term “new world” in relation to wine. Over the past couple of decades, it’s been a useful, if lazy, shorthand for the mainly southern hemisphere countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Chile and South Africa that provide much of our more affordable drinking, but I don’t think most people who use the term see it as derogatory, or would want to imply that new is inferior to old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s more a way of telling consumers what to expect from a wine. By “new world”, they’re essentially talking about the modern wine industry, rather than those countries and regions where things are done in much the same way as they always have been, as well as wines that are generally fruitier, more full-bodied and have higher ABVs than traditional old-world wines. But the term’s critics do have a point: at the end of the day, it doesn’t bear a whole lot of scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/04/old-world-wines-v-new-whats-the-difference-fiona-beckett"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>California dreaming: the sunshine state’s best wines | David Williams</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/06/california-dreaming-the-sunshine-states-best-wines</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;All too often the wines from California are seen as over-blown and over-priced, but spend wisely and there are some superb options to be enjoyed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classics California Zinfandel, USA 2020 (£8, &lt;a href="https://www.marksandspencer.com/"&gt;Marks &amp;amp; Spencer&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/strong&gt;A fun fact about California wine for your next quiz night: if the region were a country (as a small and somewhat ambitious independence movement in the state would like it to be), it would be the world’s fourth-largest wine producer after the big three of Italy, France and Spain. It is, therefore, easily the biggest non-European wine “country”, and is on its own responsible for 81% of the US’s total wine production, and a considerably higher proportion of its exports. And yet, for all its scale, I’ve never quite had the feeling its wines are treated with the same respect and affection afforded to the wines of Australia, Argentina, Chile, New Zealand and South Africa – let alone that shown to the big Europeans – on this side of the Pond. Much of the problem is down to the quality and style of the state’s cheaper, sickly sweet and artificial-tasting big-name brands. Indeed, sub-£10 pleasure is very thin on the ground, with M&amp;amp;S’s juicy bramble-jam-and-tea zinfandel a rare exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Le P’tit Paysan P’tit Pape, Central Coast, California, USA 2018 (£30.82, &lt;a href="https://www.nekterwines.com/"&gt;nekterwines.com&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/strong&gt;If the starting point, price-wise, for good California wine is higher than any other wine country, it is at least somewhat lower than it used to be – and the standard of wines once you get to that point is very much comparable with the best of the rest of the world. Tasting a range of about 70 California wines available in the UK’s independent wine merchants recently, I was struck by the quality – and diversity – of California wines in the £20 to £30 bracket. That’s nobody’s idea of cheap, I realise, but then the luminous complexity of Alma de Cattleya Chardonnay, Sonoma County 2019 (£27.95, &lt;a href="https://jeroboams.co.uk/"&gt;jeroboams.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;); the fragrant ripe red fruits of Varner Foxglove Pinot Noir, Central Coast 2017 (£19.25, &lt;a href="https://bowlandforestvintners.co.uk/"&gt;bowlandforestvintners.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;); the spicy-berry succulence of Qupé Syrah, Central Coast 2018 (£22, &lt;a href="https://www.thewinesociety.com/"&gt;thewinesociety.com&lt;/a&gt;); and the meaty-peppery savouriness of Le P’tit Paysan P’tit Pape are all at least as good if not better than comparably priced wines made from the same grape varieties in Burgundy or the Rhône Valley.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/06/california-dreaming-the-sunshine-states-best-wines"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Cocktail of the week: Joe Allen’s Jerry Thomas manhattan – recipe | The good mixer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The classic New York pick-me-up from the godfather of cocktails gets a modern makeover&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jerry Thomas was the godfather of the American cocktail, and was often referred to as The Professor. He owned and opened many saloons in New York, and wrote the very first cocktail recipe book, &lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/How_to_Mix_Drinks_Or_A_Bon_vivant_s_Comp/YixiPjSSEtoC?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover"&gt;How to Mix Drinks or The Bon-Vivant’s Companion&lt;/a&gt;. This excellent drink is one of his most famous creations. It’s an update on the original, and suits Joe Allen’s ethics of sticking to the classics but making the best version of them that we can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK readers: &lt;a href="https://www.ocado.com/search?entry=10000097331&amp;amp;utm_source=guardian-feast&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=guardian-feast-recipe"&gt;click to buy these ingredients&lt;/a&gt; from Ocado&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/28/cocktail-of-the-week-joe-allens-jerry-thomas-manhattan-recipe-rye-grand-marnier-vermouth-bitters-russell-norman"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Lab-grown chicken and ‘bleeding bean burgers’: are we ready for the future of plant-based foods?</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/norm-and-als-guide-to-being-normal/2022/jan/17/lab-grown-chicken-and-3d-printed-steak-whats-the-future-of-plant-based-foods</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From 3D-printed steak to vegan junk food, plant-based food has come a long way. But how will a climate-positive diet look in years to come?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food used to be simple. Meat was meat, vegetables were vegetables, and milk was something that came from cows. Then, more and more people started becoming conscious about the effects our diet has on the planet, chefs got more creative with plant-based ingredients, and everything started to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we have “bleeding” burgers made of beans and beetroot, “sausage” rolls made with peas, and lattes made from oat drink. A restaurant without a vegan dish is now like a pub without drinks, and every time we go to the supermarket it seems there’s a new plant-based product.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/norm-and-als-guide-to-being-normal/2022/jan/17/lab-grown-chicken-and-3d-printed-steak-whats-the-future-of-plant-based-foods"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>From flexible working to voice notes: 11 things in our lives that are ‘normal’ for 2022</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/norm-and-als-guide-to-being-normal/2022/jan/17/from-flexible-working-to-voice-notes-11-things-in-our-lives-that-are-normal-for-2022</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The pandemic and climate crisis have accelerated the pace of change beyond anything we’ve known before. So what do we now take in our stride that we’d have thought extraordinary only a few years ago?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many things we consider normal today that we wouldn’t have done just three years ago. To a certain degree, that’s life. It moves on. But at the same time, the happenings of the past few years – from extreme weather events caused by the climate crisis to the pandemic – have accelerated the pace of change far beyond what we may have previously experienced. And though it’s been dizzying at times, it’s not all bad. Sometimes it’s the biggest tests that push us to do better – to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, you’d be forgiven for having lost the thread a bit when it comes to considering what “normal” means these days. Fear not. Here’s your handy list of examples to get you back up to normal speed, just in time for it all to change again – inevitably.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/norm-and-als-guide-to-being-normal/2022/jan/17/from-flexible-working-to-voice-notes-11-things-in-our-lives-that-are-normal-for-2022"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why do we have so many different terms for plant-based eating, and what are the implications for our health, our planet and our identity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You are what you eat” has a whole new meaning in 2022. Now, it feels like every morsel we put in our mouths not only has implications for our health and the future of the planet, but also for our identity. From vegavore to vegan, climatarian to flexitarian and reducetarian, what’s behind this need to label the way we eat? Do we even need to do it when the wider culture is collectively making more plant-based choices, so making this the new normal? And do these labels unknowingly undermine our good intentions in eating plant-based?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, a “normal” diet used to mean eating meat, fish, dairy and a few standard vegetables, but that definition has grown in recent years. As lexicographer and etymologist Susie Dent explains, “normal” has meant many things over the years. “The word first appeared in an English dictionary in 1658, where ‘normal’ is defined as ‘done exactly, according to the rule’. But ‘normal’ has continued to change and grow. The question ‘what is normal?’ is not quite so simple as it sounds, and when it comes to food, things are changing fast.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/norm-and-als-guide-to-being-normal/2022/jan/17/attached-to-veganism-are-assumptions-of-elitism-countdowns-susie-dent-on-the-trouble-with-words-for-plant-based-diets"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Guy Garvey: ‘Diana Rigg was so brave – and she was a hoot. Camparis at three every day’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/16/guy-garvey-diana-rigg-rachael-stirling-elbow</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Elbow’s frontman on his mother-in-law’s death, the upside of therapy – and finally learning to love sushi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until pretty recently, Guy Garvey says, he couldn’t have sat very comfortably in a place like this. We are in &lt;a href="https://www.rokarestaurant.com/restaurant/roka-charlotte-street/"&gt;Roka in Charlotte Street&lt;/a&gt; in London’s West End, flagship of the discreetly expensive chain of Japanese restaurants, where attentive staff bring artful platters of exquisitely sliced fish and explain precisely in which order you might best consume them. “Before I met my wife I had a difficult relationship with restaurants,” Garvey says. “I never was that happy being waited on – I’d always be apologising and all ‘if it’s not too much trouble’. When we were first going out, Rachel said, ‘Do you like sushi?’ I said, ‘No not really.’ And she said, ‘Have you ever had sushi?’ I said, ‘No not really.’ She took me to this fabulous sushi place and she is great at just being natural in these places and I was immediately a convert.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This newfound ease does not extend quite to ordering; we both, diehard provincials, are a bit flummoxed by the menu, so ask for recommendations and a procession of delicate sharing plates starts to arrive, fabulous morsels of yellow-tail tartare and crab gyoza and tiger prawn tempura, which, big-shouldered blokes, we carefully manipulate with chopsticks. Garvey and his band Elbow are in some eyes a byword for northern integrity and soul. He met his bandmates at school in Bury, Greater Manchester and they have, with one exception, stayed together for 30 years and nine albums. Their first gig was at the Corner Pin pub in Ramsbottom in 1990; they now fill arenas, but Garvey has long been wary of stardom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/16/guy-garvey-diana-rigg-rachael-stirling-elbow"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Gina Yashere: ‘I’ve only been drunk twice. Why do people do that to themselves?’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/dec/11/gina-yashere-life-on-a-plate-drunk-twice-snacks-cadbury-fruit-nut</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The comedian on the perils of TV set snacks, the comfort of smoothies and the lure of sugar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My family’s Nigerian,&lt;/strong&gt; but I was born and raised in England and I was very much a British kid. So at school I had bangers and mash, toad in the hole and all the British sweets. Then I’d come home and we’d eat mainly traditional Nigerian food: jollof rice, pounded yam and okra stew. One of my favourites was cow foot, which is the cow leg cut into pieces and simmered and boiled in a stew with tomatoes and spices. I still think it’s delicious to this day, even though I don’t eat it nearly as often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a teenager &lt;/strong&gt;I slept with a can of Coke by the bed&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; I’d wake up and slurp every time I got up for a pee. I have fillings in absolutely every tooth. Including the front ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/dec/11/gina-yashere-life-on-a-plate-drunk-twice-snacks-cadbury-fruit-nut"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Stephen Graham's dramatic year: prison, care home … now a kitchen nightmare</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/nov/14/stephen-graham-on-his-big-acting-year-prison-care-home-and-now-a-kitchen-nightmare-boiling-point</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The in-demand actor’s latest role? Playing a stroppy chef on the busiest night of the year in the single-take drama Boiling Point &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking into the restaurant to meet Stephen Graham doesn’t just feel like walking on to the set of his latest film. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the set of his latest film. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JFrZZPtYrs" title=""&gt;Boiling Point&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – in which the Merseyside actor plays on-the-edge head chef Andy Jones – was shot in &lt;a href="https://jonesandsonsdalston.com/" title=""&gt;Jones &amp;amp; Sons&lt;/a&gt;, a modish London restaurant with a modern British menu, 24 hours before the first lockdown was enforced in March 2020. (Or “When Big Fuzzy Bozza said: ‘That’s it now, everyone get in your doors,’” as Graham recalls.) The movie is a “oner”, a dizzying single-take drama that goes some way to conveying the hypertension of kitchen life on “Magic Friday”, the last Friday before Christmas and the busiest night of the year. Battling debts, addiction and an imploding personal life, Graham’s kitchen nightmare unfolds in real time as he serves up the food, deals with difficult customers, berates his staff, gets ticked off by a restaurant inspector, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boiling Point&lt;/em&gt; is also a small slice of cinematic history. It is the first British one-take movie. (Of Sam Mendes’s war epic &lt;em&gt;1917&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/12/1917-review-sam-mendes-first-world-war-ww1-unblinking-vision-one-shot" title=""&gt;filmed to appear as one continuous take&lt;/a&gt;, Graham says: “Don’t get me wrong, as a feat it’s &lt;em&gt;magnificent&lt;/em&gt;. But we’ve been lied to [by the media]! It’s not one shot. Why don’t they just say it’s a film of 17 &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/sam-mendes-roger-deakins-1917-1203425116/"&gt;really long takes&lt;/a&gt;, do you know what I mean?”)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/nov/14/stephen-graham-on-his-big-acting-year-prison-care-home-and-now-a-kitchen-nightmare-boiling-point"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Edith Bowman: ‘I had a hangover for most of my Radio 1 career’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/nov/13/edith-bowman-i-had-a-hangover-for-most-of-my-radio-1-career</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The broadcaster on what she ate at her grandparents’ hotel, during her Radio 1 breakfast show and in a Japanese monastery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;grandad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; started this little hotel&lt;/strong&gt; in Scotland before I was born; my mum’s one of seven girls and five of them and their partners helped run it. It was hearty food and a lot of my nana’s recipes. I remember “desserts” was the first station I worked on when I was little: so it was pavlova, lemon meringue pie and we’d make our own ice-cream. I’m surprised I wasn’t obese because there was so much good food around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The main thing I took &lt;/strong&gt;from the hotel was the work ethic. Also being surrounded by these wonderful inspiring women: my mum and her sisters were all very different but it was a really healthy environment to grow up in and see these women running things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/nov/13/edith-bowman-i-had-a-hangover-for-most-of-my-radio-1-career"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Fergus Henderson’s ‘whole animal’ recipes inspired chefs on both sides of the Atlantic</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/feb/28/jay-rayner-on-restaurants-fergus-hendersons-inspirational-whole-animal-eating</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From a white-walled restaurant in Clerkenwell, his roast bone marrow dish has gone on to conquer the world&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is November 2009 and I’m in a new restaurant on Fairfax Avenue in Los Angeles called Animal. I have been in the city for three weeks, serving as a judge on a TV food contest, all British piss and vinegar to the familiar American gush, and I’m missing my family terribly. No matter, for here on the menu is roast bone marrow with parsley salad, the dish made famous by the chef &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/fergus-henderson" title=""&gt;Fergus Henderson&lt;/a&gt; at his Clerkenwell restaurant &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/17/fergus-henderson-recipes-classic-st-john-20-years" title=""&gt;St John&lt;/a&gt;. His guiding principle: “If you’re going to bang an animal on the head it’s only polite to eat it all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I scoop the hot, wobbly jewels of marrow from the bones, pile them on to the toast and add a little salt. Suddenly, I am no longer homesick. A few days later I fly to Chicago and visit another new restaurant. It’s called Publican. There it is again: roast bone marrow with parsley salad. “We completely acknowledge that we stole it from Fergus,” a chef says to me. “We have, like, three copies of &lt;em&gt;Nose to Tail Eating&lt;/em&gt; in the kitchen.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/feb/28/jay-rayner-on-restaurants-fergus-hendersons-inspirational-whole-animal-eating"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Radio lamington: Australian NHS workers get a taste of home sweet home</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/dec/17/radio-lamington-australian-nhs-workers-get-a-taste-of-home-sweet-home</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Homesick Australians are sending each other lamingtons by the thousand in London – and feeding frontline NHS workers too&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a box of soft, pastel lamingtons arrived at Caleb Byrt’s office, it helped quell his homesickness at a time when work was more stressful than usual. Byrt is an occupational therapist from Geelong who has lived in London for the last four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many of the best Australian wines, confectionery and telly, the lamington is a legend at home and a relative nobody away. In the UK it’s occasionally sighted at Aussie barbecues and antipodean-run cafes, or recalled by long-term Neighbours fans as the solution to many of Erinsborough’s fundraising problems, but it’s not the sort of thing you’ll find supermarkets selling in six-packs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/dec/17/radio-lamington-australian-nhs-workers-get-a-taste-of-home-sweet-home"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Lyon's a great, weird city’: Bill Buford's five years in the heart of France's food culture</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/sep/20/bill-buford-lyon-five-years-in-the-heart-of-france-food-culture</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The writer uprooted his young family to France so he could train to be a proper chef. How did it work out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/20/bill-buford-dirt-memoir-lyon-at-3am-in-bobs-boulangerie-you-could-peel-the-yeast-off-the-wall"&gt;Read an extract from Dirt, Bill Buford’s memoir of his years in Lyon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a chapter in Bill Buford’s book &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; – his hugely entertaining account of a five-year journey into the earthy, primal food culture of Lyon – in which he persuades local farmers that he should help in the killing of a pig. The blood from the animal will be used to make the pungent Lyonnaise speciality, boudin noir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with much of his book, Buford might have been careful what he wished for. The slaughter is a secretive and deeply traditional ritual. It becomes Buford’s job to stir the blood as it flows from the cut throat of the animal into a bucket, to prevent it from coagulating. Then, by mouth, he is required to blow up the casually sluiced intestines of the pig, ready to be filled by the blood and a mix of herbs and onions for the sausage. The chapter, which is not for the faint-hearted, gives an idea of the lengths to which the author went to get fully under the skin of his adoptive French city.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/sep/20/bill-buford-lyon-five-years-in-the-heart-of-france-food-culture"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
