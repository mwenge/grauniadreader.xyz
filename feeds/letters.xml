      <title>Renaissance Florence is a ludicrous model for levelling up | Letters</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2022/feb/07/renaissance-florence-is-a-ludicrous-model-for-levelling-up</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauro Martines &lt;/strong&gt;gives us a history lesson on the reality of life in Renaissance Florence. Plus letters from &lt;strong&gt;Michael Sanders,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Sylvia Dunkley &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; Yvonne Williams&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andy Haldane, co-author of the government’s big levelling-up report, wants to pair a swathe of the UK’s major material needs with the thrust of achievements in Renaissance Florence (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/05/levelling-up-report-author-uk-like-renaissance-florence" title=""&gt;Report, 5 February&lt;/a&gt;). It would be difficult to entertain a more idiotic vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florence had no coordination between public expenditure and urban improvement. Taxation staggered from one need to the next. Churches and rich patrons were the prime movers behind all major architectural commissions. Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci deserted Florence for more promising venues. The Medici began to put their hands into the public till even under the 15th-century republic. Any conception of the public good was rudimentary. The political upper class swiftly made its peace with the overmighty Medici in the 16th century. Enough said.&lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lauro Martines&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;em&gt;London&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2022/feb/07/renaissance-florence-is-a-ludicrous-model-for-levelling-up"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Boris Johnson’s death by a thousand cuts harms us all | Letters</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/07/boris-johnsons-death-by-a-thousand-cuts-harms-us-all</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Riddle &lt;/strong&gt;says that while the prime minister&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;blusters on, it is the rest of us who will experience the slow bleed of increasing prices and taxes, while &lt;strong&gt;Geoff Reid &lt;/strong&gt;is concerned about who will replace him&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nesrine Malik colourfully describes the protracted demise of Boris Johnson as a “slow bleed, rather than an immediate fall” (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/07/government-fantasy-reality-tories-boris-johnson-lies-conservative" title=""&gt;This government has been built on a fantasy. Restoring reality will cost the Tories dear, 7 February&lt;/a&gt;). She rightly suggests that because the Conservative party narrative is built on lies, it will reframe the prime minister’s lies and allow him to live another day, and then another, and yet another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those of us who have written to our local Conservative MPs about our distress at partygate and the flouting of rules seem to all have received replies with common phrases indicating that action is being taken to improve the operation at No 10. Not one word of contrition or recognition of the prime minister’s individual failings and personal responsibility.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/07/boris-johnsons-death-by-a-thousand-cuts-harms-us-all"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Why we should be asking for big pay rises | Letter</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/07/why-we-should-be-asking-for-big-pay-rises</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The goods and services that keep the high street afloat come from the spending of the masses, not the rich, says &lt;strong&gt;David Redshaw&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, it’s remarkable to see how little is understood about the workings of capitalism by those who operate at the very top of it (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/04/bank-of-england-boss-calls-for-wage-restraint-to-help-control-inflation" title=""&gt;Bank of England boss criticised for asking workers not to demand pay rise, 4 February&lt;/a&gt;). “The rich cannot buy great quantities of bread,” the economist JK Galbraith observed after the Wall Street crash of 1929 and America’s struggle to revive its economy. He meant that the goods and services that keep the high street (and its suppliers and manufacturers) going come from the everyday spending of the masses, not from the activities of the very few mega-rich speculators and rentiers who always end up causing volatility and boom and bust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While no one would want a return to the union militancy of the 1970s, it was pointed out at the time by some economists that at least the big pay rises to workers put money in their pockets to spend, which stopped the economy tilting into recession.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/07/why-we-should-be-asking-for-big-pay-rises"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>A postcode lottery that I just can’t win | Brief letters</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/07/a-postcode-lottery-that-i-just-cant-win</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Home truths | Homage to Lata Mangeshkar | The new Wordle | A gift that keeps on giving&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I moved into a newly built house in June 2020. HMRC has still not updated my postcode on its records, so passport and driving licence renewals have had to be completed by post. I have tried to complain about this using the online complaints system. After spending 45 minutes completing six pages of the signing-in process, and receiving a one-time password and my 12-digit ID, I was asked for … my postcode. &lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Rotheram&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Preston, Lancashire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• It’s hard to impress on non-south Asians what Lata Mangeshkar meant to one-sixth of humanity (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/06/lata-mangeshkar-singer-bollywood-india-dies-92" title=""&gt;Lata Mangeshkar, legendary Bollywood singer, dies at 92, 6 February&lt;/a&gt;). She was the background music of the lives of millions over many decades. In a time and place where division was – and remains – the modus operandi, she was a bridge between generations, castes, religions, and even countries. She was a national treasure.&lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sheilendr Khipple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wilmette, Illinois, US&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/07/a-postcode-lottery-that-i-just-cant-win"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Taking the heat out of soaring energy prices | Letters</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/06/taking-the-heat-out-of-soaring-energy-prices</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diana Wilkins&lt;/strong&gt; spells out measures to curb energy consumption,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; Andrew Knowles &lt;/strong&gt;bemoans the privatisation of essential services. Plus letters from &lt;strong&gt;Hilary Lang &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; Dr Christopher Sait&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid all the discussion about how to mitigate the cost of energy price rises for households (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/03/millions-uk-fuel-poverty-sunak-support-rising-energy-bills-low-income-households" title=""&gt;Report, 3 February&lt;/a&gt;), there has been no mention of how to cut energy use in the first place. Rather than offset the cost by discounts, the money would be better used to reduce long-term energy consumption by making buildings as energy-efficient as possible and thereby helping to meet climate change commitments, too. It’s not rocket science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can go a long way to improve the situation by ensuring lofts are insulated, windows are double-glazed and fit correctly, letterbox holes are plugged and external mailboxes fitted instead, draught excluders are fitted around wooden front doors, curtains have thermal linings etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/06/taking-the-heat-out-of-soaring-energy-prices"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Children in care are in dire need of mental health support | Letters</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/06/children-in-care-are-in-dire-need-of-mental-health-support</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah Champion MP&lt;/strong&gt; highlights the needs of young people in care, and &lt;strong&gt;Steven Walker&lt;/strong&gt; points to the underfunding of child and adolescent mental health services&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your report (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/04/social-workers-warn-of-rise-in-mental-health-problems-among-children" title=""&gt;4 February&lt;/a&gt;) on the rise in mental health problems among children was an incredibly important insight into the challenges they are facing. But for children and young people who have been in care, the situation is even more dire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looked-after children are already at significantly higher risk of experiencing poor mental health than their peers. Despite there only being 67 children in care for every 10,000, these individuals make up 24% of the prison population and 25% of the homeless population in the UK. What’s more, as stated in a recent report by the children’s rights campaign &lt;a href="https://serenitywelfare.org/page/hope-instead-of-handcuffs.html" title=""&gt;Hope Instead of Handcuffs&lt;/a&gt;, young people who have spent time in care are significantly more likely than their peers to find themselves classified as not in education, employment or training.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/06/children-in-care-are-in-dire-need-of-mental-health-support"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Patmore &lt;/strong&gt;suggests measures to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;protect those who feel abandoned after the relaxation of social distancing and mask-wearing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are permanent public health measures that could reduce the Covid-19 worries of vulnerable people as infection-control measures are removed, as highlighted in your article (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/i-dont-want-to-die-the-shielders-who-fear-the-end-of-covid-restrictions" title=""&gt;‘I don’t want to die’: the shielders who fear the end of Covid restrictions, 2 February&lt;/a&gt;). A proportion of train carriages could be reserved for people wearing masks, as in the era of smoking and non-smoking carriages. Downstairs on buses could serve passengers with masks, upstairs for those without. At supermarkets some tills could be reserved for queues of customers with masks. Cinemas and theatres could reserve a block of seats for those with masks. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These could be permanent measures that benefit people who are keen to avoid infection and provide a safety option for others at times of heightened infection. This would also benefit the economy, since there are plenty of at-risk people, not least among Britain’s large pensioner population, who will withhold their spending from businesses unless such commonsense safety options are offered. &lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charles Patmore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;em&gt;York&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/06/shielding-vulnerable-people-from-covid"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>There is no ‘they’ in Northern Ireland | Letters</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/letters-there-is-no-they-in-northern-ireland</link>
      <description>Local people should not blame others for the Troubles that beset Ulster for so long&lt;p&gt;The article based on an interview with Kenneth Branagh’s cousin ended with a touching remembrance of his ethnically cleansed Catholic neighbours, his final comment being “Northern Ireland can be a great place if they’d just leave us alone” (“&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/30/belfast-ken-branaghs-love-letter-to-torn-city-that-taught-him-so-much" title=""&gt;‘I grew up with Branagh in Belfast: our childhoods haunt his new film’&lt;/a&gt;”, News). That is the kind of sentiment often heard from this country that sounds significant but is actually meaningless. Who is “they” and who is “us”? Was it all someone else’s fault? The “they” who put his Catholic neighbours out were his fellow Northern Irish Protestants. As the article makes clear, some of those Protestants could have in their turn been put out by Catholics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding the involvement of the British army, indigenous tit-for-tat violence was at the core of the Troubles and the reason it went on for so long. If “they” implies some outside influence, it was only the intervention of British, Irish and US politicians in support of home-grown peacemakers that eventually ended the Troubles in 1998. Northern Ireland can be a “great wee place” (as the saying goes) but only if we Northern Irish make it so. There is no “they”.&lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephen Butcher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;Tullaghgarley, Ballymena, Co Antrim&lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/letters-there-is-no-they-in-northern-ireland"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Our wartime treatment of refugees still shames us | Letters</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/04/our-wartime-treatment-of-refugees-still-shames-us</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Readers highlight the lessons that must be learned from the hysteria that led to thousands of people being interned in Britain during the second world war&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simon Parkin’s long read (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/01/when-britain-imprisoned-refugees-second-world-war-internment-camps" title=""&gt;‘I remember the feeling of insult’: when Britain imprisoned its wartime refugees, 1 February&lt;/a&gt;) very appropriately reminds us of how easy it is for the popular press to stir up hysteria and hatred against immigrants and to influence government policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hitler’s victory in 1933 forced thousands to flee Nazi persecution. It would have been relatively easy to separate the very few imposters from the thousands of Jews, communists and other persecuted minorities who would hardly be working for the Nazis. MI5 itself had files on many of the communists, and most of those of Jewish background could be easily identified. In my book (A Political Family – the Kuczynskis, Fascism, Espionage and the Cold War) about one German-Jewish family that escaped Hitler’s Germany, Jürgen Kuczynski explains how he was interned at Seaton camp in Devon, alongside those who were Nazis, but no distinctions were made. In fact, the Nazis were often given preferential treatment. Other less fortunate internees were shipped to Canada and had to run the gauntlet of Nazi submarines; dozens lost their lives in this way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/04/our-wartime-treatment-of-refugees-still-shames-us"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Wordle’s success is based on learning from the past | Letters</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/04/wordles-success-is-based-on-learning-from-the-past</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Dowling,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Janet Fraser, Rob Doran &lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt; Ian Elliott &lt;/strong&gt;remember playing earlier versions of the game before Wordle’s viral explosion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was amused to read your editorial (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/02/the-guardian-view-on-wordle-let-the-game-stay-free" title=""&gt;2 February&lt;/a&gt;) about the internet game Wordle, created by Josh Wardle for his partner and subsequently sold to the New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to play this game on paper in the 1990s with my wife at the time and have included a brief discussion of it in my book Sociology as Method. I &lt;a href="http://www.pauldowling.me/tmr/readings/Chapter%201.pdf" title=""&gt;describe the game&lt;/a&gt; as a recontextualisation of a board game called Mastermind, which was played with coloured pegs rather than words. One player placed an arrangement of pegs hidden at one end of the board, and the other had to try to deduce the arrangement before the board was filled with their incorrect attempts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/04/wordles-success-is-based-on-learning-from-the-past"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>From science fiction to dystopian fact | Letters</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/04/from-science-fiction-to-dystopian-fact</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We shouldn’t be surprised when sci-fi writers correctly predict the future, says &lt;strong&gt;Garth Groombridge&lt;/strong&gt;, while &lt;strong&gt;Frances Starbuck&lt;/strong&gt; detects the shadow of Edgar Allan Poe looming over the current crisis at No 10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somebody at the Guardian seemed surprised that occasionally novelists and science fiction writers get the future right (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/30/the-guardian-view-on-prescience-in-novels-reading-the-future" title=""&gt;Editorial, 30 January&lt;/a&gt;). Those of us who have loved, read, or even written science fiction can only chuckle quietly at their surprise. It is the nature of future-thinking authors to take an idea, even in embryo, and run with it. Sometimes, examples such as HG Wells actually predicting a city-destroying bomb and calling it an “atom-bomb” in 1913 can be a bit breathtaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m still impressed with Ray Bradbury’s 1953 short story The Murderer, which predicts the mobile phone and house-computer, and Henry Kuttner’s Year Day (circa 1953) which predicts mass advertising and virtual reality. To me, a recent article about a visit to Donbas perfectly matched Orwell’s Airstrip One in 1984, even down to the ruined buildings, torture centre and bad coffee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/04/from-science-fiction-to-dystopian-fact"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Brush up on the meaning of Beckmann’s art | Letter</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/04/brush-up-on-the-meaning-of-beckmanns-art</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cornelie Usborne&lt;/strong&gt; disagrees with Jonathan Jones’s interpretation of Beckmann’s Die Nacht and says the painting is about war, not ‘Weimar excess’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Jones’s choice of Max Beckmann’s painting Die Nacht to illustrate “Weimar excess” was unfortunate (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/31/bootleggers-bondage-and-law-breaking-bashes-the-scandalous-history-of-the-wild-party" title=""&gt;Bootleggers, bondage and law-breaking bashes! The scandalous history of the wild party, 31 January&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far from showing a “party from hell, with bondage, in a room that’s drunkenly shrinking”, it is in fact an allegorical depiction of the tragedy of war and revolution. The viewer is forced to witness the murderous assault on a family hiding in an attic. The fact that the artist depicts his own family renders the tragedy even more poignant: the man with a bandaged head is clearly Beckmann himself; the child abducted by a revolutionary was modelled on his son, Peter; the woman tied and with splayed legs after rape is his wife, Minna. Suffused with Christian imagery, the theme is martyrdom: the strangled man with upturned soles and signs of stigmata recalls Christ’s crucifixion on altar paintings of the old masters Beckmann so much admired.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/04/brush-up-on-the-meaning-of-beckmanns-art"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Uncovering the real route of Hadrian’s Wall | Letter</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/uncovering-the-real-route-of-hadrians-wall</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sheila Spencer &lt;/strong&gt;responds to an article about Newcastle seeking its place on the Hadrian’s Wall trail and reveals interesting facts about Milecastle 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your article (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/29/newcastle-deprived-west-end-seek-boost-hadrians-wall-west-road-roman-remains" title=""&gt;‘We need to celebrate it’: Newcastle seeks its place on Hadrian’s Wall trail, 29 January&lt;/a&gt;) does not make any reference – either in the text or in the maps – to Milecastle 4, which is beneath Newcastle Arts Centre on Westgate Road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was discovered by my partner, David Fry, in 1985 and was reported formally by the then county archaeologist, Barbara Harbottle. David was the resident potter at the arts centre, leading a team to make floor tiles for the whole complex when he noticed Roman pots being thrown into a skip during the renovation of the medieval buildings. David’s excavations revealed the route of the wall in the city centre, and the location of the milecastle, which had been puzzling people. So we agree that the route of the trail going along the riverside instead of through the west end and city centre is a missed opportunity to show people the real route of the wall and the exciting finds made. &lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sheila Spencer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br incopy-break-type="webbreak"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Benton, Tyne and Wear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/uncovering-the-real-route-of-hadrians-wall"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Dear Guardian: how to improve the chances of your letter appearing in print</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2017/aug/19/letters-editor-how-to-write</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Keep it short, don’t wander from the point, get your facts straight and try to make us laugh (or cry). Yours faithfully, the letters editor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the perfect letter? For us, it’s the one that arrives about 3pm when we are trying to fill the last slot on the print page, is topical and well-argued and, handily, just about the right length. If it comes from someone with a well-known name in their field, all the better. Straight out of the inbox and on to our page layout. It happens, but not often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the most part, readers’ letters must compete with all the other emailed letters we receive each day in the “copytasting” mosh-pit. From these 200-300 letters, we select a longlist to transfer into our working files and consider for publication. (We still read the letters that arrive by snail mail, but they often reach us two or three days late.) It’s then a process of filtering until we end up with the 20 or so letters that appear on the page, with maybe a few more online. About a fifth of the letters submitted are from women – we’d love to hear from more of you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2017/aug/19/letters-editor-how-to-write"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
