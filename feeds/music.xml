      <title>‘I was getting bored so hit the vodka’ – Shakespears Sister on how they made Stay</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/07/bored-hit-the-vodka-shakespears-sister-stay-cat-women-moon</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;‘It was inspired by a fabulously kitsch 3D movie called Cat-Women of the Moon. A character has to go back to her planet and leave her human love behind’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay came to life one morning in my converted garage in the back of my house in LA: a very unassuming studio, all knotty pine and carpet, my recording equipment in a cupboard. Siobhan Fahey lived down the road and her then-husband Dave Stewart [ex-&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/dec/11/eurythmics-how-we-made-sweet-dreams-are-made-of-this-annie-lennox-dave-stewart-interview"&gt;Eurythmics&lt;/a&gt;] had given her a lift over, then he came in, because he had an idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormonally Yours is released in a 2-CD deluxe edition and coloured vinyl on 17 February, the 30th anniversary of its release.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/07/bored-hit-the-vodka-shakespears-sister-stay-cat-women-moon"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Peter Andre looks back: ‘This sauna suit would always come off mid-song’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/07/peter-andre-looks-back-sauna-suit-taking-his-top-off</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 90s pop star recreates an old photograph and talks food, fame, family – and taking his top off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born Peter James Andrea in Harrow, London, in 1973, and raised in Sydney, Australia, Andre is one of the quintessential 90s pop stars. After winning the TV talent show New Faces in Australia aged 16, he signed to a record label and launched his career in the UK, finding fame with the breakout hit &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqIq4B1rgl4" title=""&gt;Mysterious Girl and the accompanying video&lt;/a&gt; in which Andre body-rolls in a pair of jeans in the tropical sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After two No 1 singles, Andre retreated from the limelight before appearing on I’m a Celebrity … in 2004. On the show he met model and entrepreneur Katie Price, whom he married in 2005 and divorced in 2009. After a decade of reality TV, with multiple fly-on-the-wall franchises, Peter now lives in Surrey with his wife, NHS doctor Emily MacDonagh, and children. He is the co-founder of the “no guilt” health and fitness app #itsfine, available via Apple App Store and Google Play.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/07/peter-andre-looks-back-sauna-suit-taking-his-top-off"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>An orgy and then a cup of tea: Crossbreed and the new boom in sex clubs</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/07/crossbreed-queer-friendly-techno-future-of-sex-clubs</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With wellness sanctuaries and ultra-inclusive hedonism, the kink scene has reinvented itself for a new era – but you still won’t get in wearing jeans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although public physical contact has not been a defining feature of the last couple of years, London’s sex clubs are experiencing a renaissance, thanks to a generational shift. Think: fewer key bowls and CEOs in expensive lingerie, more pioneering house DJs and art students in makeshift harnesses, as younger crowds drive demand for events that foreground inclusivity, individuality and queerness. For smoke machines and St Andrew’s crosses, try &lt;a href="https://klubverboten.com/"&gt;Klub Verboten&lt;/a&gt;. For hedonism with a sense of humour, you’ll want &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/adonis.adonis.adonis/?hl=en"&gt;Adonis&lt;/a&gt;. And for women and non-binary people, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epxxgm/the-fetish-party-where-no-men-are-allowed"&gt;One Night&lt;/a&gt; offers a blend of Japanese rope bondage and R&amp;amp;B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between them all lies &lt;a href="https://crossbreedworld.com/events"&gt;Crossbreed&lt;/a&gt;, a night where underground stars such as &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/shanticeleste"&gt;Shanti Celeste&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ra.co/dj/tamasumo"&gt;Tama Sumo&lt;/a&gt; DJ to a room full of techno fans who can partake in everything from exhibitionist orgies to solo cups of tea in a dancefloor-adjacent wellness sanctuary. “The [queer fetish] community has long been dominated by gay men, who have rightly claimed and taken up space,” explains Alex Warren, who founded the event in 2019. “But that has left bisexuals, pansexuals, lesbians, trans and non-binary people with fewer non masc-dominated spaces to call home.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/07/crossbreed-queer-friendly-techno-future-of-sex-clubs"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Simply Red review – Mick Hucknall keeps holding on</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/07/simply-red-review-mick-hucknall-keeps-holding-on</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus Arena, Hull&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The singer radiates contentment as a sea of middle-aged couples sway along to his pop-soul smashers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘We’ve made it. We’re still alive!” begins Mick Hucknall. He’s obviously talking about the pandemic – more sombrely dedicating the gig to “all those who didn’t make it”. However, he could be describing the 37 years in which he’s been through some 20-odd band members, womanising, alcoholism and a brief band split to emerge as a happily married 61-year-old who radiates warmth and contentment. Despite selling 50m albums, it’s years since Simply Red’s pop-soul was contractually obliged to blare from every wine bar and taxi in the country, although you’d never know it from the sea of middle-aged couples swaying along and marvelling at the Huck’s timelessly honeyed chops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six years off the road, his famous hair hasn’t gone simply grey but the introductions are as rusty as the barnet. The Huck announces wrong songs (“Er, this isn’t For Your Babies”), shouts “Let’s go back to 1988! Er… 1985!” and introduces Gregory Isaacs’ lovers rock classic Night Nurse as “Sort yer cold out.” Such endearing off-piste moments are welcome in Simply Red’s otherwise succession of machine-polished smashers, in which the newest song dates from 2007.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/07/simply-red-review-mick-hucknall-keeps-holding-on"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Working class people are getting priced out’: cost-of-living crisis spreads to live music</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/07/how-live-music-joined-cost-of-living-crisis</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prices for big gigs such as Billie Eilish and Harry Styles are sky high – and a combination of Brexit, Covid and ticket touts means they aren’t likely to fall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Robson Scott, a live music fan from Newcastle, went to his first gig in 2011, he remembers paying&lt;a href="https://www.utilitaarena.co.uk/events/katy-perry/"&gt; around £30 for a standing ticket&lt;/a&gt; to see &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/katy-perry"&gt;Katy Perry&lt;/a&gt; at Utilita arena. Ten years later, he says, “for arena gigs of that calibre you’d usually be paying over £65.” That’s a rise that far exceeds the UK’s rate of inflation during that time, &lt;a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/inflation/inflation-calculator"&gt;which was 2.6% per year, on average, or the equivalent of £8.90&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A scan of current ticket prices for artists who are at the superstar level that Perry was in 2011, when she’d had a string of No 1 hits and had released her most successful album Teenage Dream a year earlier, confirms Scott’s experience. Standing tickets for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/billie-eilish"&gt;Billie Eilish&lt;/a&gt;’s 2022 tour are around £75 for UK arena dates, for example, while Robson recently paid £89 for a standing ticket to see &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/harry-styles"&gt;Harry Styles&lt;/a&gt; at Emirates Old Trafford.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/07/how-live-music-joined-cost-of-living-crisis"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The True Blood actor on growing up in a house full of jazz and rock’n’roll, and his daughter introducing him to Mother Mother &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first song I remember hearing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;My mum and dad met at a jazz club in Ilford, east London, so I grew up in a house full of jazz and 50s rock’n’roll. Aged four or five, I’d do an impression of Elvis singing Hound Dog, complete with the knees and shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first single I bought&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I remember going to this excellent independent record store, Kelly’s Records on Brentwood High Street, aged nine or 10, to buy Start! by the Jam. For a long time I thought George Harrison had taken the riff from Paul Weller and used it on Taxman, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/07/louis-prima-has-been-in-my-head-since-i-first-saw-the-jungle-book-stephen-moyers-honest-playlist"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>‘I want Jesus Christ Superstar at my funeral – live!’: Mel Giedroyc’s honest playlist</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/31/i-want-jesus-christ-superstar-at-my-funeral-live-mel-giedroycs-honest-playlist</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first single she bought was by Queen and she belts out Joan Jett at karaoke, but what gets the presenter going at the Zoom disco?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The last song I streamed&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Herbie Hancock, Watermelon Man. My brother runs a gospel choir, he’s a jazzer. A lot of my musical education came from him. When I was listening to Shaddap You Face, he’d be listening to Buddy Rich, John Coltrane, the cool ones. He got me totally into Herbie Hancock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first single I ever bought&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The one, the legendary BoRap: Bohemian Rhapsody. I had to go halves with my sister Coky. In 1975 I was seven and she was 12, and we each saved up 15p for it. We were obsessed. It got played so much, I’m amazed that the grooves on the record were still able to hold a needle. I think I’ve still got it somewhere.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/31/i-want-jesus-christ-superstar-at-my-funeral-live-mel-giedroycs-honest-playlist"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;He could request Frank Sinatra before he could speak, and recites Noël Coward lyrics, but what does the singer-songwriter enjoy behind closed doors?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first song I remember hearing&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;It’s a family legend that even before I was forming sentences, I knew how to request I’ve Got You Under My Skin sung by Frank Sinatra on the record player. Of course I’m biased, but my wife [jazz musician &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/03/diana-krall-this-dream-of-you-review-second-to-none"&gt;Diana Krall&lt;/a&gt;] does the other, definitive version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/24/after-seeing-aretha-franklin-youre-never-the-same-again-elvis-costellos-honest-playlist"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Mitski, the US’s best young songwriter: ‘I’m a black hole where people dump their feelings’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/04/mitski-us-best-young-songwriter-im-a-black-hole-where-people-dump-feelings</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With songs about heartbreak and capitalism, the cult pop singer is on the brink of the mainstream – but the intensity of her fandom has her fearing for her safety&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a jokey meme that captions a picture of Mitski with “Therapists HATE her”. Her songs can make you doubt what love, happiness and stability are even for. Over the course of six albums, the 31-year-old has become the US’s best young singer-songwriter, stating her feelings with dry amusement or real pain. Her songs are vignettes heavy with painterly symbolism. She connects squalling indie-rock to ambient ballads with plenty in between; her chords never resolve in the way you think they will, rather like life. Perhaps therapists hate her because she is putting them out of a job – as well as being troubling, her music is often uplifting, cathartic and compassionate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out she is in therapy herself. “I love therapy! Having someone to talk to, who you don’t feel like you’re burdening, because it’s their job – it really eases up all your friendships,” she says, laughing. “You’re saying it out loud, giving it words; it clears things up. In America, there’s still this notion that you’re not good until you’re happy. I hope we can get away from that.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/04/mitski-us-best-young-songwriter-im-a-black-hole-where-people-dump-feelings"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Lauren Laverne: ‘My biggest disappointment? Myself – that’s my Catholic upbringing’</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The presenter and musician on caravan holidays, mean people and sobbing over Strictly Come Dancing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in Sunderland, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/lauren-laverne" title=""&gt;Lauren Laverne&lt;/a&gt;, 43, formed the band &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/sep/22/cult-heroes-kenickie-lauren-laverne" title=""&gt;Kenickie&lt;/a&gt; when she was a teenager and released two albums before becoming an award-winning broadcaster. She presents BBC 6 Music’s breakfast show, and has hosted Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs since 2018. Her new TV series is The Big Design Challenge on Sky Arts. She is married with two sons and lives in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When were you happiest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are different flavours of happy, but I think my favourite is the quiet contentment when several generations of family are sitting together watching a crowd-pleaser like Harry Potter on the telly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/05/lauren-laverne-interview-catholicism-caravan-holidays-strictly-come-dancing"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Pixies frontman Black Francis: ‘Kim Deal? We’re always friends – but nothing is for ever’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/03/pixies-frontman-black-francis-kim-deal-were-always-friends-but-nothing-is-for-ever</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the alt-rockers release a live box set, their frontman answers your questions on Bowie, his 40 new Pixies songs and the alarming sexuality of his pets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;on Pilgrim is the greatest debut album by anyone, ever. Discuss.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;mungoslut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will partially agree, at least to appear humble. But seeing as I’m not so humble … I was listening to Murmur by REM a lot just before Come on Pilgrim and that was hugely influential on me as a songwriter. I’m going to be cocky and say: we were even better than Murmur.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/03/pixies-frontman-black-francis-kim-deal-were-always-friends-but-nothing-is-for-ever"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Sax star Immanuel Wilkins: ‘Hands are a symbol of praise – but they are also lifted up at police’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/01/immanuel-wilkins-jazz-saxophone</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At 24, the saxophonist is being hailed as one of the most promising jazz artists in the US – and his music, which explores faith and Black cultural vitality, is utopian in an America that isn’t&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immanuel Wilkins appears on a video call from his flat in Brooklyn, looking intently at the laptop perched on top of his Fender Rhodes keyboard. A column of light bounces off his forehead, and his red circular glasses magnify his eyes ever so slightly, making him look particularly absorbed in conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re speaking before the release of The 7th Hand, the follow-up to his Blue Note Records debut (“an alto saxophonist whose playing is at once dazzlingly solid and perfectly lithe”, trilled the New York Times, as the album topped its best jazz of 2020 poll). He’s warm, effusive and a tad nervous. There’s a tantalising moment where he considers playing the Rhodes to explain a point, before getting tongue-tied, reconsidering and starting again. He’s only 24, and yet this new album – which examines spirituality in its artwork and contemporary dance in its videos – is mature and adventurous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/01/immanuel-wilkins-jazz-saxophone"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>James Blunt review – larky king of uncool turns on the emotion</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/04/james-blunt-review-brighton-centre</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brighton Centre&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kicking off an arena tour, the self-deprecating noughties singer-songwriter shows he is not the one-hit wonder he jokes he is, with a range spanning beige balladeering to fists-clenched intensity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is, says James Blunt, the first night of his Greatest Hit tour. The crowd cheers. “That’s ‘hit’ singular,” he adds. “I’m going to play &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/14/james-blunt-how-we-made-youre-beautiful"&gt;You’re Beautiful&lt;/a&gt; 22 times.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, very on brand for James Blunt these days. His vast mid-00s success came with equally vast accompanying opprobrium – perhaps inevitable when an unnecessarily handsome Eton and Sandhurst alumnus shifts 11m copies of his ballad-heavy debut album, with sales driven by Radio 2. But Blunt has proved exceptionally adept at owning his role in popular culture. His witty, self-deprecating tweets are renowned. As Neil Young removed his music from Spotify, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/29/james-blunt-twitter-spotify-joe-rogan-podcast-neil-young"&gt;Blunt threatened to add more of his&lt;/a&gt;, for example, and similar stuff fills the gaps between songs tonight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/04/james-blunt-review-brighton-centre"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Smile review – Yorke and Greenwood stay close to the mothership</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/05/the-smile-live-stream-thom-yorke-jonny-greenwood-tom-skinner-magazine-london</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magazine, London&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thom Yorke’s latest Radiohead spin-off, alongside Jonny Greenwood and Tom Skinner, excels the more it explores new territory in a thrilling frenzy of analogue synths and percussion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In primates, what looks like a smile usually signifies submission. In humans, it’s more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a smile of love and there is a smile of deceit,” intones a disembodied voice – actor Cillian Murphy’s – at the start of the third live performance in a series by &lt;a href="https://www.thesmiletheband.com/"&gt;the Smile&lt;/a&gt;, the latest band headed up by Thom Yorke of Radiohead. The power trio is completed by fellow ’Head &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/09/radiohead-jonny-greenwood-cocaine-hook-me-up-recorder-group-classical-label"&gt;Jonny Greenwood&lt;/a&gt;, latter-day composer of film soundtracks, and drummer Tom Skinner of jazz activists &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/sons-of-kemet"&gt;Sons of Kemet&lt;/a&gt;. (Producer Nigel Godrich is a silent partner.) It’s a sunny January morning outside, contrasting with the dimly lit, alternative Sunday service indoors, in which a churchy Fender Rhodes features. The band have snuck a few hours’ kip after their earlier 11pm and 1am live streams. The only sign that they are not fresh as daisies is one slight mistake on one song.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/05/the-smile-live-stream-thom-yorke-jonny-greenwood-tom-skinner-magazine-london"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Nova Twins review – the loudest, most exciting new rock band in the UK</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/03/nova-twins-review-moon-cardiff</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Moon, Cardiff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kept from their natural habitat during the pandemic, the duo now have people crowdsurfing on the ceiling with their thunderous yet precise blowouts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good things come to those who wait. “Are you ready to go in?” Nova Twins guitarist and vocalist Amy Love asks, safe in the knowledge that some of the people jammed in front of the stage have had tickets to this show for more than two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having put out their debut album Who Are the Girls? weeks before the UK’s first Covid lockdown, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/12/new-band-of-the-week-nova-twins"&gt;the hype around Nova Twins&lt;/a&gt; was kept at a simmer by the feeling that, with live shows largely on the shelf, a key ingredient was missing. Here, with their neon-punk stage gear lit up in striking pinks and greens, everything falls into place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/03/nova-twins-review-moon-cardiff"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The Smile review – Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood give prog rock tendencies full rein</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/30/the-smile-review-thom-yorke-jonny-greenwood-radiohead-live-stream</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Radiohead duo, joined by Sons of Kemet drummer Tom Skinner, pair memorable dynamics with typically uneasy lyrics in an intriguing if meandering performance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1997, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/radiohead"&gt;Radiohead&lt;/a&gt;’s bassist Colin Greenwood was asked about Pink Floyd, a band whose name kept being mentioned in relation to their then-new album &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/22/radiohead-ok-computer-oknotok-1997-2017-review-prescient-and-correct"&gt;OK Computer&lt;/a&gt;. His younger brother Jonny was a fan, he said, and had made the band watch the 1972 film Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii. “Dave Gilmour sitting on his arse playing guitar, and Roger Waters, with long, greasy hair, sandals and dusty flares, staggers over and picks up this big beater and whacks this gong,” he protested. “Ridiculous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a quote that comes to mind while watching the live stream of the second gig by the Smile, the latest project from &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/30/the-smile-review-thom-yorke-jonny-greenwood-radiohead-live-stream"&gt;Jonny Greenwood &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/thom-yorke"&gt;Thom Yorke&lt;/a&gt; – an album’s worth of material performed in the round before an audience, the band’s three members in a kind of circular cage made of LED strip lights – and considering what the difference is between the music they’re making and that of Radiohead. The most obvious point of departure is that the drum stool is occupied by Tom Skinner, of acclaimed London jazz band &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/sons-of-kemet"&gt;Sons of Kemet&lt;/a&gt;, whose presence noticeably alters the band’s rhythmic flow. He’s perfectly willing to play a pounding Neu!-inspired Motorik beat on We Don’t Know What Tomorrow Brings, but more often you notice the stuff that divulges his jazz chops: the suppleness and slipperiness about his playing, the emphases that don’t always appear where your rock-trained ears expect them. Equally, it’s hard to avoid the feeling that, in the Smile, Greenwood and Yorke are allowing their prog rock tendencies full rein, unencumbered by band mates’ grumbling about sandals and flares. Greenwood’s guitar riffs are complex and knotty – there’s a particularly fantastic, percussive example driving Thin Thing – the time signatures are frequently lurching and awkward, the songs’ structures are uniformly episodic. “Don’t bore us, get to the chorus,” sings Yorke on Open the Floodgates, presumably in character as the kind of unconscionable simpleton who requires such artless baubles: there certainly aren’t any choruses here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Smile is &lt;a href="https://dreamstage.live/show/the-smile-series"&gt;available to stream on demand&lt;/a&gt; for a 48 hour period from 2pm GMT on 30 January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This review was updated on 30 January 2022 to correct an error: the concert was not sponsored by Spotify. It was further amended on 31 January 2022 to correct a misspelling of Jonny Greenwood’s first name as “Johnny”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/30/the-smile-review-thom-yorke-jonny-greenwood-radiohead-live-stream"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Turnstile review – raucous return of the hardcore punk live show</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/31/turnstile-review-raucous-return-of-the-hardcore-punk-live-show</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rock City, Nottingham&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Baltimore band hit the stage with the ferocity of uncaged wild animals as Covid restrictions are finally lifted&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After two years of the pandemic and largely socially distanced gigs, the scenes here feel surreal. Every inch of the sold-out, ram-packed venue hosts a heaving body. Hair is flailed and heads are banged. A succession of fans – many of them upside down, chunky footwear in the air – crowdsurf towards the stage, where they are helped down by security. Some people manage to actually get on the stage itself, launching themselves skyward back into the heaving throng.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jubilant atmosphere is partly informed by this week’s abandonment of Covid restrictions – only the venue’s powerful new ventilation system suggests anything has changed since 2020 – but also reflects how the Baltimore, Maryland band have become arguably the current hardcore punk scene’s most exciting band. Turnstile certainly stepped up a level with last year’s eclectic third album, &lt;a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/turnstile-glow-on/"&gt;Glow On&lt;/a&gt;, which combines hardcore with elements of soul, psychedelia and at least one Latin-funk breakdown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/31/turnstile-review-raucous-return-of-the-hardcore-punk-live-show"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Animal Collective: Time Skiffs review | Alexis Petridis's album of the week</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/03/animal-collective-time-skiffs-album-review</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Domino)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dialling down the psychedelic mayhem, the quartet’s reflective windchimes-and-bamboo album preaches lyrically to their loyal choir &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From its title, to its lyrics – which variously advise listeners to treat “every day as an image of a moment that’s passed”, “put the baggage down” and count one’s blessings compared to those who “find their way in a hearse” – to the warped version of Big Ben’s chimes that open a track called We Go Back, Animal Collective’s 11th album is a record that feels obsessed with the passing of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And why wouldn’t it be? The US quartet have been together nearly 20 years. It’s 13 years since their commercial and artistic peak, 2009’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jan/09/animal-collective-merriweather-post-pavilion"&gt;Merriweather Post Pavilion&lt;/a&gt;, on which a band who had always wobbled unsteadily along the line that separates the impressively exploratory from the hopelessly self-indulgent hit a graceful stride. That is an album that now feels redolent of a different age, worthy of &lt;a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/article/animal-collectives-merriweather-post-pavilion-was-radical-enough-to-redefine-indie-music-why-didnt-it/"&gt;nostalgic retrospective pieces&lt;/a&gt; on American music websites, hymning the “the pre-algorithm era of tastemaking guided by the prominence of MP3 blogs”: an era in which Animal Collective looked like they might cross over to mainstream acceptance. Certainly, the nature of its success suggested it was attracting attention far beyond its usual constituency: Beyoncé reworked a line from its standout single My Girls on her universally lauded album Lemonade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/03/animal-collective-time-skiffs-album-review"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Black Country, New Road: Ants from Up There review – a baroque pop masterpiece</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/06/black-country-new-road-ants-from-up-there-review-a-baroque-pop-masterpiece-isaac-wood</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Ninja Tune)&lt;br&gt;With now departed frontman Isaac Wood its playful driving force, the London band’s inspired second album is best heard in a single sitting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things rarely associated with fun: 1) free jazz, 2) math rock, 3) Black Country, New Road. On the London band’s second album there is less of the “fire in a pet shop” jazz than on their 2021 debut &lt;em&gt;For the First Time&lt;/em&gt;, but there are still whiplash changes of time signature and songs that take forever to get going. Thankfully, music isn’t just about fun: it can be about creating remarkable soundworlds of baroque pop fantasias, and this band are outstanding at those.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Arcade Fire, BC,NR’s playfulness and humour is unfairly overlooked, smothered by an intensity that seems utterly inimical to fun. Maybe it’s not quite &lt;em&gt;TV Burp&lt;/em&gt;, but Isaac Wood’s voice, heavy like a father’s frown, solemnly obsessing over Billie Eilish, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjC4qXiBRu4&amp;amp;t=1s"&gt;Concorde&lt;/a&gt; and “the clamp”, is a hoot. Shame that he unexpectedly &lt;a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/black-country-new-road-vocalist-isaac-wood-announces-departure-from-the-band-3150451"&gt;left the band last week&lt;/a&gt;, as he’s often the best thing about it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/06/black-country-new-road-ants-from-up-there-review-a-baroque-pop-masterpiece-isaac-wood"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Mitski: Laurel Hell review – a deep dive you can dance to</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/06/mitski-laurel-hell-review-valentine-texas-everyone</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Dead Oceans)&lt;br&gt;The indie artist delivers devastating emotional truths and unsettling imagery – with sharp hooks and an 80s pop sheen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Made up in equal parts of emotional pop bangers and riveting electronic anomie, &lt;a href="https://www.mitski.com/"&gt;Mitski&lt;/a&gt;’s hotly anticipated fifth album does not disappoint. This Japanese American indie artist’s strides towards the mainstream are laced with resonant themes; disembodied hands, cleanliness and “the dark” recur as images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hooks are sharp. A series of tunes skew hard towards sleek, oversaturated 80s pop. In addition to the maximalist cris de coeur &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmXFF_whkVk"&gt;The Only Heartbreaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4J3Z9xgjWQ"&gt;Love Me More&lt;/a&gt; – both previously released – Mitski packs in bouncy romps such as Should’ve Been Me, outlining the pitfalls of a relationship with deceptive orchestral cheer. The dulcet Americana of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvIkcN5YMH4"&gt;Heat Lightning&lt;/a&gt; could sit easily alongside the notionally more commercial work of Lana Del Rey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/06/mitski-laurel-hell-review-valentine-texas-everyone"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Maya Shenfeld: In Free Fall review – 21st-century tech communes with the ancient</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/04/maya-shenfeld-in-free-fall-review</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Thrill Jockey)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The Jerusalem-born sound artist’s debut invokes the transcendent via a compelling mix of analogue synths, brass and human voices&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maya Shenfeld trained as a guitarist, learning classical guitar at university in her native Jerusalem and later playing electric guitar in assorted art projects in Berlin. You can see her online, playing her instrument through &lt;a href="https://mayashenfeld.com/2016/08/16/guitar-control/"&gt;a laptop and a host of effects pedals&lt;/a&gt;; improvising over tape loops; or &lt;a href="http://www.mayashenfeld.com/2019/05/30/gay-guerrilla-girls/"&gt;leading&lt;/a&gt; an ensemble of 11 guitarists to rework Julius Eastman’s minimalist classic Gay Guerrilla until it sounds like a Sonic Youth track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Shenfeld’s debut album doesn’t feature any guitar. Instead it explores texture and grain using analogue synths, brass and human voices. A lot of music rooted in drone-based minimalism can be quite harmonically tedious, but Shenfeld’s compositions go places. Sadder Than Water, the longest track here, sounds like a Bach fugue being played in slow motion by Wendy Carlos; Body, Electric is a series of descending, constantly modulating synth arpeggios over a warm blanket of drones; Voyager sounds like one of the more compelling instrumentals from David Bowie’s Low. Shenfeld also creates space-age soundscapes using acoustic sources: the opening and closing tracks create sepulchral tones by exaggerating the natural resonances of brass instruments; while Mountain Larkspur sees her getting a youth choir to sing in ghostly, microtonal harmonies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/04/maya-shenfeld-in-free-fall-review"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Saba: Few Good Things review – rapper ponders a half full glass</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/04/saba-few-good-things-review-grieving-rapper-breathes-out-his-pain</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Pivot Gang)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;While his previous album was a melancholic paean, this record sees the Chicago MC appreciate what he has&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost five years after the fatal stabbing of his cousin and Pivot Gang collaborator John Walt in 2017, Chicago rapper Saba – real name Tahj Malik Chandler – is still grieving. In 2018, he responded to the tragedy with the album Care for Me: a complex, melancholic paean, hot with denial, sometimes sunk under by depression. Few Good Things sees Saba resurface, moving beyond the acceptance stage on an album that sounds and feels like one long exhale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Few” in the title doesn’t point out a lack of something, but an appreciation for those things – home, family (Saba’s appears in recorded snippets throughout), happiness – that he does have, and he paints this, on 2012, in shades of youthful innocence: snips of birdsong, rolling snares, and a blissed-out chorus of “I had everything I needed, everything” – all tales of bunking school in pursuit of friendship and first loves. The title track is a highlight, and ties knotty emotions into a neat bow: “Glass half full, the other half was the emptiness / We turned a bunch of nothing to abundance.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/04/saba-few-good-things-review-grieving-rapper-breathes-out-his-pain"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Anaïs Mitchell: Anaïs Mitchell review | Alexis Petridis's album of the week</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/27/anais-mitchell-anais-mitchell-review-bmg</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(BMG)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;After her Broadway success with Hadestown, the indie folk artist returns with a set of lowkey but polished melodic gems, boasting sharp lyrics and striking emotional gear-changes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the 2000s turned into the 2010s, Anaïs Mitchell seemed an easy artist to peg. Her career was plodding along in unassuming style, somewhere in the region where country and folk meet alt-rock. She had well-reviewed albums released on her own label, sessions for the Bob Harris show on Radio 2 and NPR’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Shr47LVcA5I"&gt;Tiny Desk&lt;/a&gt;, support slots with Bon Iver. That was before she developed a Greek mythology-themed song from her 2007 album The Brightness into &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/nov/05/hadestown-national-theatre-london-anais-mitchell-rachel-chavkin"&gt;a small-scale musical called Hadestown&lt;/a&gt;, which turned into an album featuring Justin Vernon and Ani DiFranco – a sort of Pitchfork-friendly equivalent of the all-star concept albums that Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice used to drum up interest in Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita. That begat an off-Broadway production, which in turn begat a Broadway production, which won eight Tony awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its unexpected success leaves Mitchell in a curious position. A feted Broadway writer, she is apparently planning another musical, but her eponymous seventh solo album – her first of original material in 10 years – sees her picking up where she left off as a singer-songwriter. Or more-or-less: the success of Hadestown means there’s substantially more media interest than before, and her cottage industry label Wilderland has been junked for a deal with BMG. But that notwithstanding, Anaïs Mitchell is an album for which the adjective “unassuming” might have been invented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/27/anais-mitchell-anais-mitchell-review-bmg"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Eating Glass)&lt;br&gt;The ex-Crystal Castles singer’s solo debut is pulsing and personal…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A debut solo album more than 15 years into your career would be a tricky transition for any musician; it’s hard to fathom how difficult it must be for &lt;a href="http://www.aliceglass.com/"&gt;Alice Glass&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017, she &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/25/alice-glass-crystal-castles-ethan-kath-sexual-assault-abuse"&gt;alleged that Ethan Kath&lt;/a&gt;, the other half of Canadian electronic punk duo &lt;a href="https://www.crystalcastles.com/"&gt;Crystal Castles&lt;/a&gt;, had subjected her to years of sexual, physical and emotional abuse, starting when she was 15. (Kath sued for defamation; the case was dismissed.) The last words of &lt;a href="http://www.aliceglass.com/cc"&gt;Glass’s statement&lt;/a&gt; then were “I am still recovering”, and trauma casts a deep shadow over &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://ffm.to/preyiv"&gt;Prey/IV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, four years in the making. “You’re not worth believing,” she sings on the scissoring, shuddering Pinned Beneath Limbs. “Don’t talk to your friends/ Don’t talk to your family.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Produced by her partner, Jupiter Keyes, formerly of LA digital noise-rockers &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/09/health-death-magic-review-dated-and-attention-seeking"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, the album holds a thread of continuity with Glass’s musical past, but its pulsing beats, churchy-gothic synths and spurts of racing techno create a warmer, deeper space, allowing her soft tones – formerly so often shrouded in hails of digital noise – to emerge, speaking of self-hatred, pain and mutilation. There’s also the energy of recovery. On The Hunted, roles are reversed, predator becoming prey as Glass asserts “I’m stronger than you” over booming, glossy dubstep drops. “You’re a cliche/ You screw up everything,” she intones on Fair Game, mimicking Kath’s words. “Now,” she says, “I dance along to it and laugh.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/30/alice-glass-prey-iv-review-songs-of-trauma-and-recovery-jupiter-keyes"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Stan Tracey Trio: The 1959 Sessions – genius brewing</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/29/stan-tracey-trio-the-1959-sessions-genius-brewing</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Resteamed)&lt;br&gt;Six years before he defined a new British style of jazz, the pianist and composer was already out on his own&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows by now that a distinctively British style of jazz emerged in the 1960s, and it’s often said that Stan Tracey’s &lt;em&gt;Under Milk Wood&lt;/em&gt; suite (1965) was its first unmistakable masterpiece. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.resteamed-records.com/product/the-1959-sessions-new-product/"&gt;The 1959 Sessions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, from a tape recently unearthed during a studio clear-out, is six years pre-masterpiece but welcome nonetheless. As both pianist and composer, Tracey developed his style under the twin influences of Ellington and Monk. This set him apart from the usual run of modern jazz in the 50s, and there was always the slight doggedness of the loner about him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the eight tracks here, three are standard songs, one a venerable jazz number and four are Tracey originals. The songs bring out the Monkishness – displaced accents, sudden excursions into unlikely keys – all performed with faultless accuracy. The originals are more intriguing, because in each one the improvised solos grow inseparably out of the tune. The best of the lot, for me, is the splendid, up-tempo Pitter, Patter, Panic. Technically, it’s not a perfect recording, even for 1959, but it shows that, by the start of the 60s, Tracey was already a force to be reckoned with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/29/stan-tracey-trio-the-1959-sessions-genius-brewing"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Meat Loaf was a spellbinding performer who fused sincerity with showmanship</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/21/meat-loaf-spellbinding-performer-jim-steinman</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The hard-rock icon injected even the most absurd songs with deeply felt emotion and formed the perfect musical partnership with Jim Steinman &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/21/meat-loaf-bat-out-of-hell-singer-dead-at-74"&gt;Meat Loaf: Bat Out of Hell singer dead at 74&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/21/share-your-tributes-and-memories-of-meat-loaf"&gt;Meat Loaf: share your tributes and memories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a mean-spirited and cynical argument that Michael Lee Aday owed his career to someone else’s talent: &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/apr/21/jim-steinman-master-of-the-power-ballad-gave-pop-an-operatic-energy"&gt;the late songwriter Jim Steinman&lt;/a&gt;, who wrote everything on Meat Loaf’s 43m-selling breakthrough album Bat Out of Hell, rescued his career when it was in the doldrums by agreeing to make 1993’s Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell and was behind virtually every song for which Meat Loaf will be remembered. Of the 18 tracks on The Very Best of Meat Loaf, only four were not written by Steinman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s certainly true that Meat Loaf found things much tougher without Steinman on board. Steinman had hits with other people – the Sisters of Mercy and Celine Dion among them – but not one of the Steinman-less albums Meat Loaf released in the 80s was a hit in the US. European fans remained a little more loyal and he occasionally scored a UK hit, most notably the distinctly Steinman-esque Modern Girl in 1984. But he spent most of the decade relentlessly touring in order to stave off bankruptcy, and the leap in sales between his 1986 album Blind Before I Stop – which had its greatest success in Switzerland, reaching No 22 – and Bat Out of Hell II, a global number one that sold 14m copies, tells its own story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/21/meat-loaf-spellbinding-performer-jim-steinman"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Bikes, fights and debauchery: Meat Loaf at the movies</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/21/bikes-fights-and-debauchery-meat-loaf-at-the-movies</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The singer appeared in dozens of films without ever finding a landmark role – but his turns in Fight Club and The Rocky Horror Picture Show are hard to forget&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meat Loaf’s songs were so inherently cinematic – the hysterical melodrama of I’d Do Anything For Love (But I Won’t Do That), the three-act sex-comedy of Paradise By the Dashboard Light, the biker-movie wildness of Bat Out of Hell – that they seemed to emerge not from the speakers but from a rowdy drive-in or a tumbledown picture palace. Perhaps that explains why he never found (or went looking for) the sort of distinctive movie role that would have decanted his persona on to the screen like David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth, Madonna in Desperately Seeking Susan or Prince in Purple Rain. A single signature movie might have over-egged the Meat Loaf, or else looked measly next to songs that felt like all-night film shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If any performance distilled his essence, it was the one he gave in The Rocky Horror Picture Show in 1975. His first major role, it came two years before the release of Bat Out of Hell and feels now like a taster for that album. As the biker Eddie, he roars out of the deep freeze and into the pristine laboratory of Dr Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry) and his guests (Christopher Biggins among them), fouling up the place with his uncouth manner and nasty exhaust fumes. Bellowing out Hot Patootie (Bless My Soul) and parping on his saxophone, he introduces some grubby animal magnetism into the air of camp debauchery. It doesn’t last long: Frank-N-Furter kills him with a pick-axe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/21/bikes-fights-and-debauchery-meat-loaf-at-the-movies"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Elza Soares: samba’s greatest star epitomised the vivacious spirit of Brazil</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/21/elza-soares-samba-greatest-star-brazil</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The singer’s melodic, growling voice was a marvel – and she overcame great hardship in order to put it to astonishing use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elza Soares stood quietly, a few minutes before being born into music. Engulfed by audience fuss and hullabaloo, another of her competitors had been disqualified from the radio talent show she was attending. It was 1953, and Soares had just one chance to bring home the cash prize – she needed it to help care for her unwell son. She was still a teenager and, once on stage, her oversized, ragged dress would make the audience explode into laughter. “What’s the planet you came from?” asked the host, waiting for the gag’s cue. “I’m from Planet Hunger,” she said. Silence took hold of the venue, and Elza sang for the first time. She never stopped, until her &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/20/elza-soares-one-of-brazils-greatest-ever-singers-dies-at-91"&gt;death this week aged 91&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the decades, the Brazilian artist became a staple for samba, a mainstay of her nation’s songbook and a singer that shared a global pantheon with Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday. Dubbed the “voice of the millennium” by the BBC in 1999, Elza met the Planet Hunger as few did: a Black woman born in Rio’s favelas, who faced down racism, sexism and classism with brilliant verve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/21/elza-soares-samba-greatest-star-brazil"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>No one else sounded like the tough yet tender Ronnie Spector</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/13/ronnie-spector-ronettes-singer-hits</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The late Ronettes singer had one of the most distinctive voices in pop music – and her discography should be celebrated beyond her girl-group hits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/12/ronnie-spector-pop-singer-who-fronted-the-ronettes-dies-aged-78"&gt;Ronnie Spector, pop singer who fronted the Ronettes, dies aged 78&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid the jaw-dropping stories of horrific abuse in Ronnie Spector’s 1990 autobiography Be My Baby, there’s a fascinating passage about her singing voice. She says she felt cowed by the other female singers in Phil Spector’s stable of stars: she didn’t have the kind of big, gospel-trained voice that Darlene Love or Fanita James possessed. But the producer had singled her out for special treatment. Veronica Bennett, as she was then, had “exactly what he needed to fill the centre of this enormous sound”, she said. Phil Spector was famous for rounding up whoever was in the studio to sing backing vocals, but he demurred when Ronnie offered. You could see that as an early example of the controlling behaviour with which he made her life a misery after their marriage, but his explanation was pretty convincing: “Your voice is too distinctive – it comes right though.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was right. Phil Spector worked with a succession of fantastic singers – not just Love and James, but the Righteous Brothers, Tina Turner and LaLa Brooks of the Crystals – but none of them sounded like Ronnie, a state of affairs that makes a mockery of the notion that Phil Spector was the solitary artist at work on his records, his vocalists interchangeable puppets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/13/ronnie-spector-ronettes-singer-hits"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Neil Young: 'You don't want to OD on music'</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/04/neil-young-autobiography-relief-music</link>
      <description>Neil Young's marvellously idiosyncratic autobiography, Waging Heavy Peace, rummages through his 50-year career – and offered its writer a relief from music&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/oct/04/neil-young-song-ohio-autobiography"&gt;Read an exclusive extract from Waging Heavy Peace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are perhaps more relaxing preparations for interviewing Neil Young about his autobiography than reading Neil Young's autobiography. It's not that &lt;a href="http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780241962176,00.html" title=""&gt;Waging Heavy Peace&lt;/a&gt; isn't a good book. It is, albeit in a very Neil Young-ish way. Over the course of its 500 pages, Waging Heavy Peace is variously wildly idiosyncratic, unpredictable, bafflingly digressive, wryly funny, deeply moving, plain-speaking, still in thrall to the mysticism of the late 60s, painfully honest – "do not doubt me in my sincerity," counsels Young at one point, "for it is this which has brought us to each other now" – infuriatingly elusive and shot through with moments of rare insight and beauty, which you might say makes it the perfect literary counterpart to the 50-year career it describes, in a fairly roundabout way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone hoping for a chronological hop through Young's triumphs – the astonishing run of albums that stretches from 1969's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everybody_Knows_This_Is_Nowhere" title=""&gt;Everybody Knows This is Nowhere&lt;/a&gt; to 1979's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_Never_Sleeps" title=""&gt;Rust Never Sleeps&lt;/a&gt;, the supergroup Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp;amp; Young, his early 90s resurgence, borne by the alt-rock scene&amp;nbsp;his music inspired – is going to&amp;nbsp;go home very disappointed indeed. The main criticism of it is that it has a tendency to ramble, but as fans at Crazy Horse's &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/01/arts/music/global-citizen-festival-with-neil-young-to-combat-poverty.html?_r=0" title=""&gt;recent show in New York's Central Park&lt;/a&gt; would have told you&amp;nbsp;– perhaps as their version of 1991's Love and Only Love entered its 14th minute, with no sign of a conclusion in sight – Young is an artist who has&amp;nbsp;always reserved the right to&amp;nbsp;ramble on a bit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/04/neil-young-autobiography-relief-music"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Kate Ceberano’s most memorable gig: Michael Hutchence was like a sun god and Princess Diana glowed</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The I’m Talking singer was starstruck and beset by dark premonitions when she joined the Rocking With the Royals lineup in Melbourne in 1985&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/series/my-unforgettable-gig"&gt;this Guardian Australia series&lt;/a&gt;, our favourite musicians reflect on their most memorable concerts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s one gig in my 40-year career that sticks in my mind – probably more for sentimental than musical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m Talking – the stylised funk band I fronted in the 80s – were part of the lineup for Rocking With the Royals, the concert performed at the Melbourne Concert Hall (now Hamer Hall) on 4 November 1985 for Prince Charles and Lady Diana, who were in town for Victoria’s 150th anniversary celebrations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/08/kate-ceberanos-most-memorable-gig-michael-hutchence-was-like-a-sun-god-and-princess-diana-glowed"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Masters of heaviness Rolo Tomassi: ‘I’ve never expected music to offer me a living’</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/02/masters-of-heaviness-rolo-tomassi-ive-never-expected-music-to-offer-me-a-living</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nearly two decades into their career and recording around their day jobs, the South Yorkshire-born band have made a genre-defying masterpiece – but they remain an enigma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve seen the 1997 crime drama LA Confidential, you’re already familiar with the cryptic words Rolo Tomassi. It’s the name that the film’s protagonist – idealistic policeman Ed Exley, played by Guy Pearce – gives to the faceless criminal that murdered his father. “No one even knew who he was,” the detective divulges to his stoic sergeant. “I just made the name up to give him some personality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar mystery hangs like noirish fog around the band of the same name. On a musical level, they’re unclassifiable; arguably the most inventive heavy band currently working in the UK, who have made a masterpiece nearly two decades into their career. New album Where Myth Becomes Memory flits between seemingly incompatible genres: opening track Almost Always commences with shoegaze guitars, framing the silken singing of lead vocalist Eva Korman, then follow-up Cloaked plummets into a twisted metal riff as Korman snarls and screams. Post-rock, hardcore punk, piano pop and synth music all ensue before the LP has struck its final chord.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/02/masters-of-heaviness-rolo-tomassi-ive-never-expected-music-to-offer-me-a-living"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Syl Johnson, much-sampled blues, funk and soul singer, dies aged 85</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Singer’s upbeat and socially conscious songwriting appears on tracks by Wu-Tang Clan, Public Enemy and Kanye West &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syl Johnson, the blues, funk and soul singer whose work was much sampled in US hip-hop, has died aged 85.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No cause of death was announced by his family, who said of Johnson: “He lived his life as a singer, musician and entrepreneur who loved black music … A fiery, fierce, fighter, always standing for the pursuit of justice as it related to his music and sound, he will truly be missed by all who crossed his path.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/06/syl-johnson-much-sampled-blues-funk-and-soul-singer-dies-aged-85"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>
